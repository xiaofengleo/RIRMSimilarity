envri project did an analysis of the characteristics and requirements of environmental research infrastructures ris by comparing some of these
with common reference model the outcomes proved to be helpful for the understanding of strengths and weaknesses in the outline
and planned developments of the ris the current envriplus project has more ambitious programme and it was felt that the
analysis should be updated and expanded this report refreshes and revises the information about the environmental research infrastructures ris primarily
those engaged in envriplus and available technologies in order to clarify requirements identify issues and highlight opportunities the main subjects
in this report were selected by the ris themselves nevertheless the team involved in this product noticed additional common requirements
of priority and it was decided to also take these up in supporting the ri developments all findings and recommendations
will be used within the envriplus project to inform the subsequent work research developing the required information has helped develop
vital channel of communication between computing specialists with application specialists and strategists the report is divided into three main parts
the results of systematic requirements gathering section page onwards the integration of broad technology review section page onwards and an
assessment of their quality and their characterisation section page onwards including implications shaping future actions section page onwards collation of
possible impacts on the envriplus project and on its participating organisations is presented in section page as this is long
document forming compendium of work map to help readers find the parts that interest them is provided figure on page
this deliverable document is meant for two purposes first of all it is description for the stakeholders as an effective
route by which to pass the new information collected to the user communities the aim is to develop and share
an agreed viewpoint on the research infrastructure researcher user requirements the ri asset offerings and the available technology now and
in the near and further future the document is primarily for the ris participating on envriplus and their communities but
it should also be helpful to other ris delivering similar services in any scientific or application domain second important factor
is that it is contribution to an envriplus project review this work is undertaken as task in work package wp
which itself is part of closely related group of work packages forming theme this theme is concerned with the design
development and implementation of infrastructure methods services and tools that will help ris more easily manage and fully exploit their
data this report should help theme integrate and steer its work to meet the priorities of the research infrastructures project

environmental and earth system research infrastructures projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create coherent interdisciplinary and interoperable
cluster of environmental research infrastructures across europe it is driven by three overarching goals promoting cross fertilization between ris implementing
innovative concepts and devices across ris and facilitating research and innovation in the field of environmental understanding and decision making
for an increasing number of users outside the ris envriplus aligns its activities to core strategic plan where sharing multi
disciplinary expertise will be most effective the project aims to improve earth observation monitoring systems and strategies including actions to
improve harmonization and innovation and generate common solutions to many shared information technology and data related challenges it also seeks
to harmonize policies for access and provide strategies for knowledge transfer amongst ris envriplus develops guidelines to enhance trans disciplinary
use of data and data products supported by applied use cases involving ris from different domains the project coordinates actions
to improve communication and cooperation addressing environmental ris at all levels from management to end users implementing ri staff exchange
programs generating material for ri personnel and proposing common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating
the socio economic impacts envriplus is expected to facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single ris
and at the inter ri european and global level it promotes efficient and multi disciplinary research offering new opportunities to
users new tools to ri managers and new communication strategies for environmental ri communities the resulting solutions services and other
project outcomes are made available to all environmental ri initiatives thus contributing to the development of coherent european ri ecosystem

project did an analysis of the characteristics and requirements of environmental research infrastructures ris by comparing some of these with
common reference model the outcomes proved to be helpful for the understanding of strengths and weaknesses in the outline and
planned developments of the ris the current envriplus project has more ambitious programme and it was felt that the analysis
should be updated and expanded this work was undertaken by task described in the dow as follows re analyse the
status of involved ris in envri plus along the dimensions of data users software services and resources in order to
update the requirement study performed in the early phase of envri together with interoperability requirements based on use cases in
wp6 and the review of data and computing infrastructure such as egi helix nebula and eudat such analysis will point
to commonalities between ris differences between ris interoperability between ris and the state of the art of ri technologies the
characterisation of ris under common documentation method which may employ vocabulary defined in existing envri rm allows comparison and discussion
leading to best practice and consistent development plans for ri improvement and also ri interoperation this task will take actions
to update requirements from all involved ris define common documentation methods for describing the current status of ris this should
include any data management issues that affect the ri internally or affect interoperation perform consistent characterisation of existing and planned
ris and their user requirements within their principal community and in interoperation with other ris review the state of the
art of technologies provided by data and computing infrastructures recommend suitable design and engineering approaches for common operations between ri
projects by maximally reusing existing industrial standards and existing tools the information collected from and expressed by the research infrastructures
ris participating in envriplus shows after analysis that there are common issues and technological opportunities that were anticipated when envriplus
was proposed nevertheless the team involved in this report noticed additional common requirements of priority and it was decided to
also take these up in supporting the ri developments the primary examples are see section on page onwards for complete
coverage and details the need to achieve data harmonisation consistency of representation interpretation and access both within and between ris
the need to learn from one another and pool efforts in order to accelerate and harmonise delivery of data services
and working practices that support well each stage of the scientific data lifecycle from data acquisition to delivery of actionable
derived information help with facing the challenge of sustainably delivering data services immediately to meet current ri priorities while taking
into account longer term issues and technology trends however care must be taken not to overestimate the pervasiveness of these
similarities for example differences in maturity lead to substantially different priorities many ris currently face setting up internal collaborative support
for the early stages of data acquisition whereas long established ri such as euroargo prioritises improved access to existing data
products and differences in the internal diversity and prevailing collaborative arrangements between ris epos incorporates more than independent organisations with
different priorities in broad spectrum of geosciences and practices whereas eiscat 3d has comparatively small number of participants all focused
on studying the upper atmosphere such differences lead to significant differences in working practices and related requirements however there is
near universal agreement that the key performance indicator used by ris is researcher productivity hence envriplus focuses on removing inconsistencies
and impediments from researchers working environment as data wrangling can consume large proportions of researcher time it only rarely requires
insight from domain experts and so can be eliminated by appropriate automation prior infrastructure investments particularly in the more mature
ris have to be considered these are not just the capital investment in equipment software and services they are also
the training and development of working practices that become manifest in cultures and collaborative arrangements that have widespread often global
community support as well as long term and substantial value the requirements gathering was organised in terms of general information
gathering see section starting on page and the primary topics of theme which are identification and citation section page curation
section page cataloguing section page processing section page provenance section page optimisation section page and community support section page each
of these topics contains information from ris and then an analysis that collects collates and interprets the gathered information the
majority of the details are held in wiki2 the achievements and limitations of the requirements gathering are assessed in section
page onwards to large extent the gathered requirements match the expectations when envriplus was planned examples of the kinds of
extra requirement that emerged are given in section pages onwards these are predominantly about simplified packaging and early exemplars of
functionalities that are already being addressed the technology review updates the understanding of the technologies that are pertinent to theme
it will inform future work in theme and help those steering ris make technical decisions the review was conducted over
relatively short period thus we drew on existing knowledge and understanding within the project and updated our assessment of technology
primarily by considering authoritative or active information resources such as relevant groups in standardisation organisations research data alliance rda open
geospatial consortium ogc and worldwide web consortium w3c we collaborated with eudat to share technology review information and with ris
using the technologies the technology review was organised in terms of the six pillars underpinning theme work plan see figure
on page and four cross cutting aspects of technology that need to influence every pillar introduction and explanation of the
technology review methodology used section on pages onwards this introduces the technology reporting structure each topic was led by topic
leader who identified the topic the information sources and referenced material they developed an analysis pertinent to the two to
four year horizon that is relevant within the envriplus project lifetime they also developed longer term view by assessing the
trends in their area this is relevant for those making strategic investment and planning decisions in ris review topics the
six pillars of technological focus the review of technology pertaining to data identification and citation section pages onwards here the
challenge of minting and using reliable references to data is analysed and potential solutions are concisely compared making these mechanisms
precise and widely adopted is key to data curation cataloguing provenance and optimised workflow processing it is also key to
proper acknowledgement of data creators and data publishing institutions the review of technology pertaining to data curation section pages onwards
preserving all relevant artefacts in today data driven science is challenging to do this in ways that encourage interchange and
cross domain use of data is even more challenging however such activities are essential to achieve quality and reliability in
the results produced and to successfully address today intellectual and societal challenges potential strategies for building on existing platforms and
standards while accommodating diversity are carefully explored the review of technology pertaining to cataloguing section pages onwards with today rapidly
growing diversity and wealth of data finding data quickly and interpreting it correctly is crucial the catalogues underpin this capability
which is used intensively by researchers and the software they employ the review draws on deep experience and existing global
campaigns to lay out the options for the envriplus communities the review of technology pertaining to processing section pages onwards
processing data storage and data transport underpin every other activity in the data lifecycle from data acquisition or production to
curation and publishing it is mature field of great diversity with well supported general solutions and growing number of specialised
technologies to deliver capabilities specific to certain categories of data and algorithms map of this complex field is presented that
includes continuity of many established tools and working practices but also reviews the emerging capabilities of data intensive platforms and
workflows needed for scientific and data management methods the review of technology pertaining to provenance section pages onwards the use
of provenance is essential to achieve and validate high quality research it supports the automated collection of records about how
data was produced the inputs the processes applied and who organised that production it can be selectively applied and users
can add their own annotations it is required for curation and for review of conclusions but it may also be
used for diagnostics help with data management and rapid reruns there is deep discussion and analysis of the options for
its implementation and candidate standards the review of technology pertaining to optimisation section pages onwards optimisation has to be considered
for every aspect of the data lifecycle and for the majority of working practices that have moved into production it
is motivated either by aspects of the user experience proving problematic or by resource consumption becoming unacceptable the engineering approaches
needed to address such issues are identified the handling of these issues are much helped by ensuring that the platforms
and subsystems have the right levers for optimisation engineering it is clear that one off solutions are rarely affordable particularly
in the long term consequently metadata driven automated optimisations are the appropriate strategy review topics the four cross cutting aspects
of technology the review of technology pertaining to system architectures section pages onwards this explores the options for combining the
many functions and capabilities in the typical distributed context recommended strategy has logically unified core that manages such things as
definitive catalogues with many external resources and data sources attached standards pertinent to this organisation example systems and current rda
discussions are recommended the issues to be faced in infrastructure architecture are illustrated by considering routes to interoperability this exposes
the critical importance of careful decision making during the early stages of infrastructure design and development the review of technology
pertaining to semantic linking section pages onwards the precise descriptions of data and services will never use the same terminology
everywhere furthermore the chosen terms structures notations and vocabularies all evolve as the environmental and earth sciences develop and as
the growing wealth of digital devices and of data exposes new information the strategy for not just coping but for
making the best use of this wealth of data depends on automation built on formalised logical descriptions the review of
technology pertaining to reference model section pages onwards reference models enable the many organisations engaged in building or revising an
infrastructure to describe the crucial structures and agreements so that the system eventually fits together well and performs as intended
this is particularly relevant for the many ris and groups of ris that are going to become dependent on their
infrastructures it will aid the design planning and implementation phases the reference model provides vocabulary and conceptual framework for many
of today pressing infrastructure decisions its development and wider use will pay off substantially for the ris from their strategists
and technical teams building their infrastructure to the researchers and other users who expect it to be consistent perform well
and contain the automation they need the review of technology pertaining to the supply and use of compute storage and
network resources section pages onwards everything that all of those handling data does everything that the teams building and maintaining
infrastructure do and everything that the user communities and citizen scientists do depends on the strength power and availability of
this underlying layer crucial contribution is the many layers of platform software and subsystems that the infrastructures depend on carefully
chosen these supporting resources can provide much of the sophisticated system engineering needed greatly reduce the system and software maintenance
burdens for ris and deliver support to developers and users the locations of these technology review topics are summarised in
table table technology review topics technology topic section page data identification and citation data curation cataloguing processing provenance optimising architectures
semantic linking reference model compute storage and network resources the technology reviews listed above are assessed and analysed to identify
their scope and implications in corresponding sections of section pages onwards namely sections to for the specific topics and sections
to for the aspects of technology that apply to all of the subsystem pillars these assessments are preceded by four
strategic considerations that should shape the current reported in those sections but should also influence the long term planning of
the ris of collaborating computational resource providing organisations and the funders of infrastructures the critical importance of skills in collaborating
effectively between roles and between disciplines crossing these intellectual and cultural barriers is essential to make ris and infrastructures successful
and to address today societal challenges it is equally important in business and government the envriplus community should be leaders
in developing and valuing these boundary crossing behaviours because the future of europe economy and societal well being depends on
that capacity section the integration of the mathematical models that have described natural phenomena very successfully since newton time are
complemented by the powerful statistical methods exploiting our new wealth of data that took off at the start of this
millennium the fourth paradigm how to harness both of these approaches together remains challenge in many disciplines individual solutions are
developing in many disciplines but principle and both intellectual and technical frameworks are needed to nurture this alliance section almost
all ris and all the campaigns to address societal challenges depend on building effective alliances between many autonomous organisations and
establishing rules and practices for sharing their independently owned data these organisations often need to meet priorities of their funders
governments they continually improve their offered services and they are often involved in many such consortia we name these alliances
to present consistent and convenient view of independently owned data as data intensive federations the governance principles and technologies will
all benefit from developing shared kernel that can be used by many data intensive federations section the handling and exploitation
of data depends on growing bodies of software the interfaces and data transformations delivering holistic view depends on similar complex
assembly of software the working practices and scientific methods and the convenient interfaces that make them accessible takes more software
the science and the scientists depend as much on their software as on their instruments the software strategy for ris
and for other infrastructure builders must take careful account of the often overlooked question of sustainability ways of doing this
are introduced section to support the characterisation of the outcomes and implications five categories are introduced in section these are
building on task results how do we take forward and develop the collected information and judgements raising the abstraction level
in the universe of discourse how do we make best use of the reference model to improve the applicability of
statements and highlight commonalities awareness raising and training we all need to improve our understanding knowledge and skills to work
across boundaries address ever greater scales of data and activity and deal with the complexities of the natural and artificial
systems usability and take up investing in advanced infrastructures and encoding sophisticated scientific and data management methods will be to
no avail if the practitioners do not exploit the new capabilities how do we keep them engaged and show the
potential shared subsystems and sustainability how do we minimise the parts which have to be maintained by small group of
ris and how do we ensure that those parts are maintainable using these categories section lists twenty five suggested actions
that envriplus should consider this is not intended to be an exhaustive list and others should add to it and
refine it it is particularly important that those addressing use cases ensure that their requirements are inserted in future versions
of this list its initial content will be used as the basis for discussion during the spring envri week6 these
actions will ensure that envriplus and the ris hear about this comprehensive body of work through extracts highlighting particular issues
they will also build on the material developed here to make it living resource for the project think tanks may
be formed to pool intellectual effort gather sufficient breadth of experts and to ensure viewpoints are balanced competition might be
run that will select from proposals for think tanks those that will best serve the environmental cluster communities the more
strategic and wider implications are summarised in section starting on page with backward references to the details that lead to
them again these are indicative and more thought should be given to the population of this list of eight items
and to the exact form of response each item warrants the current items are improving interdisciplinary collaboration how should we
invest in the skills and capabilities of our communities so that we become more expert at collaborating across discipline role
and organisational boundaries leading the formation of global environmental sounding board the context for thinking together and planning from the
viewpoint of the environmental cluster but on global scale needs developing combining both statistical and numerical methods expertise in using
numerical models is well established the use of statistical methods is advancing rapidly but how well developed are the methods
for making them work together sharing computationally expensive results when large investments have been made to compute result that has
to be represented by large volumes of data how best do we share the benefits and encourage others to take
advantage of the results data intensive federation support many environmental research activities depend on dynamically sharing data from autonomous organisations
framework that enables this for many federations each able to use it to tailor their own would yield significant benefits
software sustainability the whole of the data lifecycle and all data driven science depends on software software is expensive and
difficult to maintain the ris will expect it to work for many years this will require careful choices of software
and sufficient resources to meet the remaining software maintenance costs promoting ict harmonisation harmonisation yields benefits when dealing with border
crossing collaborative research and inter disciplinary data sharing but its greatest benefit is to help with the software sustainability challenge
by pooling effort and by creating sufficiently consistent and extensive demand that ict vendors become interested in co development and
supply how should decisions be made the items above and the competing pressures for improvement mean that decisions need to
be well informed to balance long term and immediate issues and need authority that leads to their proper adoption the
mechanisms by which current ict decisions are made will probably benefit from review and revision this document is compendium of
many individual investigations searches researches discussions analyses and judgements as such it is indigestible taken as whole we therefore present
map to help readers navigate to the parts that interest them see figure figure map of this document showing topics
and treatments of the investigations those concerned with particular topic curation can follow the relevant column and colour scheme orange
possibly also taking into account relevant general matters and cross cutting issues similarly those interested just in requirements can follow
the corresponding rows as can those just interested in technology reviews those concerned with implications are invited to read those
sections with red borders those concerned with strategy and long term planning should focus on the topics with double red
boarders if you start reading with specific viewpoint there are sufficient cross references in the running text to lead you
to relevant material we hope readers will enjoy the contents as we have enjoyed assembling it of course had we
had more time we could have investigated much further every topic certainly warrants it similarly more judgement and analysis could
have been invested to sharpen our conclusions however this moment is an appropriate one from the point of view of
envriplus and from the point of view of completeness and depth to share this with you we will greatly appreciate
feedback and comments to improve future versions and to shape future plans and judgements introduction data has been crucial in
science since observations and experiments began archimedes must have measured the displaced water for his eureka moment the advent of
digital instruments and the intensive use of computers has transformed the ways in which we study and interpret phenomena jim
gray coined the term fourth paradigm for this transition in after working intensively with astrophysicists exploiting sky surveys szalay as
szalay points out this has transformed every branch of science their wealth of data doubling every year offers tremendous opportunities
for developing new understanding but it also poses immense challenges in how to handle and exploit that wealth of data
well all of the sciences concerned with the earth and the environments it offers are experiencing this transition many of
the research infrastructures in envriplus are engaged in generating and exploiting that data the project aim is to help them
do this as well as possible helping them optimise their working practices and the platforms that support their data pipelines
from distributed data generators instruments sensors observers to storage use presentation and application this advances from the previous model where
individual researchers assembled data and analysed it as one off step the new data scales diversity and complexity mean that
such one off approaches are no longer feasible or supportable burns today societal challenges such as hazard mitigation and sustainable
resource provision require new interdisciplinary approaches pooling resources insights data methods and models it is challenge for the collaborating environmental
ris to be leading in supporting researchers in this challenging scientific field thus in the envriplus context the data driven
science opportunities and challenges are compounded and also crucial for each individual ri in the upcoming years although the ris
have to shape their own ict strategy which will be addressed in the next paragraphs this report is first step
in supporting them in approaches to common problems there are therefore immense potential benefits from shared solutions that envriplus hopes
to encourage in reducing barriers thereby facilitating boundary crossing developing common understanding of requirements is first step this will need
to build on strategies for globally sharing data the international sharing of meteorological data commenced in the advent of networks
of digital observation systems and the multiple methods of computationally deriving data poses new data sharing challenges these were first
explored for curated computationally produced digital data in by the ray crystallographers they set about openly sharing their data about
the structures of biologically significant molecules such as haemoglobin8 they mandated that any publications reporting new structures had to be
matched with pdb deposited data set the stages by which this evolved over the first years to meet new needs
and to exploit the advances in ict are given in berman today pdbe the european support for pdb is just
one of life science curated reference data sources the environmental research infrastructure elixir9 supports its community includes world leading centres
at the frontier of data driven science consequently it has very advanced infrastructure and sophisticated strategies for developing it further
envriplus is more likely to learn from such research infrastructures than influence them there are many others in the environmental
research infrastructure cluster that have deep histories and are similarly advanced collaborative sharing of reference data archives with much improved
technology is now widespread in all sciences and certainly key in environmental sciences where global consortia are capturing and sharing
data about many aspects of the earth and its biosphere given the scale and maturity of many environmental research infrastructures
envriplus needs to focus on finding ways of improving their interaction by sharing methods and solutions and enhancing the opportunities
for combing data from multiple ris it may be instructive given this goal of sharing methods solutions and data among
large investment research campaigns to review strategy that worked well for digital astronomy innovation in such context was pioneered by
astrophysicists for sharing many significantly different sky surveys they call their scientific gateways that give access to the collection of
data produced by one sky survey virtual observatory vo they recognised the significant advantage from all of these vos offering
consistent services for both human interaction and computational interaction this meant the careful definition and verification of globally adopted standards
but that had to avoid the undesirable effects of lock in to poor standards and the chaotic effects late agreement
on newly needed standards as each instrument and observing campaign introduced new data and as each advance in data analytics
required new elements in their catalogues astrophysicists therefore took matters into their own hands and formed the international virtual observatory
alliance ivoa this speedily judges new requirements encourages researcher led proposals and verifies global adoption of agreements typically through six
monthly cycles of catalogue re builds ernst mayr pointed out that biological systems are more complex than physical systems mayr
this makes the development and adoption of effective relevant and widely adopted standards much more important for environmental and earth
sciences and many of those consulted echoed this sentiment however it also makes the task more challenging and that challenge
is exacerbated by the connection with societal challenges and economic factors that mean many additional viewpoints need to be considered
the inspire directive is one example eu parliament we can envisage an international virtual earth and environment alliance iveea to
take on this mantle it is doubtful whether this can be grown in the context of existing organisations once an
organisation such as iveea exists it would take responsibility for long term and detailed campaign of requirements gathering and analysis
as necessary precursor to agreeing and adopting standards such an initiative is foreseen already by esfri esfri as recommendation for
the long term but we suggest this needs to be accelerated such body could also complement the belmont forum the
world collective of major and emerging funders of global environmental change research the envriplus communities might consider the value of
such body and decide to nurture its creation the last decade has seen the emergence of data science this has
emerged as four factors have combined the rapid increase in volumes of collected data stored within one regime google the
rapid increase in the affordable power to conduct statistical analyses over very large volumes of data substantial advances in the
machine learning methods that have become feasible because of the above two factors and significant successes using these techniques in
finance business science and medicine envriplus is committed to enable the ris and their research communities to fully exploit data
science advances this poses both intellectual and technical challenges as these are propagating through the environmental and earth sciences contemporaneously
with envriplus aston they are perturbing factor that should be considered as we gather and analyse requirements the requirements gathering
began from the start of the envriplus project and continued as number of parallel dialogues with oversight by the topic
leaders and coordination by the task leaders please see below for definitions of terms the results were collected and refined
in the envri community wiki12 which will be referenced frequently throughout this report it should be consulted for detail and
for up to date information as the wiki will be active after this report is completed these requirements were then
reviewed and summarised by the topic leaders the state of that material when this report was completed led to the
summary information in the sections below we first present the methods used we then present each of the topic areas
around which requirements gathering was focused for each of these topic areas there is an initial summary that digests and
assesses the overall information gathered then within each topic area we briefly review the information per ri that was engaged
in the process we conclude with short summary for that topic that identifies and quantifies common factors and enumerates any
exceptions review of existing ris their requirements requirement gathering methods and completion status task aims to re analyse the status
of involved research infrastructures13 ri in envriplus along the dimensions of data users software services and resources in order to
update the requirement study performed in the early phase of envri the precursor to envriplus describing the commonalities differences and
interoperability between ris and reviewing the state of the art of ri technologies the requirements study used the following workflow
conducted in parallel by individuals from each ri and also employed by the project pairs and small groups committing to
focus on topic and in many cases context starting new page to record their findings and delimiting their scope working
progressively to refine and record their understanding of their chosen focus recording progress on their page and linking to uploaded
files and cited references for details indicating their progress by revising their status reporting to the weekly theme meeting when
appropriate contributing to the wiki and deliverable report engaging in handover to subsequent tasks and ris at the end of
this independent and concurrent requirements gathering the topic leaders see below reviewed collated and analysed these focused descriptions to develop
an integrated overall report on requirements in their area and discussed these with the wider team these are summarised later
in this report from section page onwards the first step of the requirements study was to define common method for
describing all aspects of the information and communication technologies ict that are needed to provide the facilities and capabilities required
by researchers using environmental research infrastructures ris this led us to group the requirements under seven common topics identification and
citation mechanisms to provide durable references to data objects and collections of data objects curation processes to assure the availability
and quality of data over the long term cataloguing catalogues are built to accelerate access to data subsets that can
be delimited by queries over catalogue they may optimise work by containing frequently required data derivatives so that many scientists
use these instead of re computing them this of course needs to be supported by appropriate apis metadata and steps
in formalised methods which appear under processing and optimisation they also advertise the data resources that particular service or collection
has so scientists and software know when to use the underlying facility either the same or similar catalogues may collate
and yield access to formalisations of methods and working practices often encoded as services scripts workflows or other forms of
software processing this includes every computational transformation of data including but not restricted to the following examples processing and selection
of raw data close to instruments including signal processing analysis of data for quality assurance qa purposes or to derive
results used elsewhere simulation runs with subsequent comparison with observations etc provenance this is concerned with recording information about how
data code and working practices were created and were transformed to their current form it not only records such historical
information it also works as foundation for many tools that help researchers organise and evaluate their research optimisation optimisation transforms

support yin chen egi to coordinate concurrent requirements gathering the activecollab tool14 was used all the information requested by each
topic leader was collected in single document15 that document describes the information to be gathered for each topic including generic
information such as the size and maturity of each ri that pertains to all of the topics the generic material
is gathered in the wiki with the title generic requirements and background once the topics and generic requirements were defined
the next step was to design communication strategy figure below this strategy involved three roles topic leaders who partitioned and
shaped investigations at the start to identify the information they would like gathered at the end of the requirements gathering
period they reviewed integrated and interpreted the gathered information about their topic and produced summary and analysis taking into account
their own knowledge and their work package wp commitments they had opportunity to interact with the go betweens throughout the
requirements gathering process ri representatives gathered information about their ris and communicated it to their ict ri go between this
often triggered follow up discussions with others ict ri go betweens focused on one or few ris and gathered information
from their ris recorded it in the wiki or activecollab page and fed it to the relevant topic leaders they
also arranged follow up discussions with one or more topic leaders when these were requested figure three roles engaged in
requirements gathering the role of topic leader is defined in the joint envriplus activecollab communication tool16 they had to be
receptive to input from ict ri go betweens and had to partition and delimit their topic to minimise duplication of
work by those contributing to their topic the role of an ri representative rirep was to collect and present to
requirement gatherers information about their ri requirements including its existing inventory of facilities its plans as they affect technical choices
their alliances with infrastructure providers and the work of various roles within their ri who need better data facilities they
introduced others from their ri into the requirements gathering process to work directly on specific issues or topics these have
been identified by formal responses in the activecollab17 the role of an ict ri go between gb was to avoid
duplication of effort by an rirep in an ri they are responsible for otherwise an rirep might have had to
field overlapping questions from succession of topic leaders the gbs were guided by common set of information requirements19 they developed
an awareness of the common factors that have to be completed to meet the standard template for requirements reporting20 common
set of actions time issues and deadlines for the interactions between gb and rirep were defined in activecollab21 once each
gb agreed to take the responsible for at most four ris table they identified the rirep for each of their
assigned ris later gbs conducted sequence of interactions with the rireps to build an understanding of that ri requirements and
to develop written record that they both agreed to these interactions were always initiated by collecting the generic requirements and
background in the subsequent interactions information for each topic was gathered then gbs communicated that understanding and record to the
relevant topic leaders each pair gb rirep kept their collected records in an activecollab notebook page one per ri22 on
some occasions gbs with the rirep arranged direct communications between others in the ri for topic and then delegated the
pursuit of more detailed understanding and requirements to them within the ethical framework such delegation of direct communication was explicitly
consented initiated and written up three of the research infrastructures do not appear in the tables namely eurofleets2 jerico and
esonet because their requirements are covered by seadatanet and euro argo more specifically the eurofleets2 research infrastructure does not have
an integrated data management infrastructure instead it relies on seadatanet network of data centres the jerico research infrastructure does not
have an integrated data management infrastructure it relies on seadatanet for long term data preservation and distribution it relies on
copernicus marine service for real time data management for the esonet research infrastructure the requirements are not yet fully determined
but seadatanet contributes to esonet data management as consequence although envriplus represents research infrastructures only are shown in each table

they protected their privacy and arranged that they were deleted once used they ensured that participants agreed to the written
record before it was passed on to others to use each topic leader integrated and summarised the initial information gathered
by gbs raising issues needing clarification if necessary and produced an integrated overview summary and collation of the material for
their topic these appear in the wiki and snapshot is summarised in this report the requirements coordinator integrated the topic
leaders results and developed an executive summary and integrating overview asking for clarifications when necessary the collected information varies by
topic and by ri possible reasons for this are discussed in section the current status is recorded in table where
tick indicates the information was gathered recorded and agreed by the stakeholders the crosses indicate requirements investigations that have not
been completed various reasons led to this the topic was not relevant at this time in that ri the topic
was known to have been covered by another ri with the same requirements or the relevant experts were unable to
allocate sufficient time to reach completion in other cases an infrastructure is too complex to be described in all its

designed to derive new data products including information and knowledge in many cases there is much more complex pattern as
successive uses repeat such cycles for example seismological observations are recorded and analysed in near real time to detect earthquake
events and to alert responders if the magnitude and location warrant such actions the accumulated and quality controlled traces from
seismometers are archived and curated as globally agreed and accessible data these are supplemented by other deployments such as the
us seismic array and the responsive deployments after major earthquake to obtain data from the aftershocks these data are then
correlated to identify subsurface phenomena such as changes in the seismic wave velocity normally due to change in temperature or
compared with wave propagation simulations based on earth models results from that misfit analysis can be back propagated to refine
the earth model using data from many earthquakes and seismometers the earth models can eventually reflect phenomena in the mantle
such as thermal plumes that manifest themselves in the lithosphere as chains of islands such as the hawaii archipelago french
these earth models can then be compared with the fluid dynamics models of mantle convection to refine those models clearly
data representing successive models depends on many phases each of which treats the results from the previous phase proceeds through
number of data driven or model driven scientific methods and delivers results worthy of archiving and curation the generic aspects

information about actris actris aerosols clouds and trace gases research infrastructure addresses the scope of integrating state of the art
european ground based stations for long term observations of aerosols clouds and short lived gases31 the overall goal of actris
is to provide scientists and other user groups with free and open access to high quality data about atmospheric aerosols
clouds and trace gases from coordinated long term observations complemented with access to innovative and mature data products together with
tools for quality assurance data analysis and research actris is composed of observing stations exploratory platforms instrument calibration centres and
data centre with three data repositories also called topic databases near surface data eusaar aerosol profiles earlinet and cloud profiles
cloudnet currently actris is developing new database with satellite data linked to actris ground based data actris would like through
their participation in envriplus to improve their interoperability so as to make their data as accessible and understandable as possible
to others to understand which are the best practices when researchers need to discover data to link with others ris
because there are many points in common technologically and scientifically and to improve through the experience of other ris actris
expects that envriplus will provide technology advice for planning and managing the activity of sensors developing understanding of how instruments
work in extreme conditions and improving the capabilities of small sensors generic information about anaee anaee analysis and experimentation on
ecosystems focuses on providing innovative and integrated experimentation services for ecosystem research it will strongly support scientists in their analysis
assessment and forecasting of the impact of climate and other global changes on the services that ecosystems provide to society
anaee will support european scientists and policymakers to develop solutions to the challenges of food security and environmental sustainability with
the aim of stimulating the growth of vibrant bioeconomy32 it is the intention of anaee to provide excellent platforms with
clear accessibility conditions and service descriptions and clear offering to researchers the gathering of information in common portal should help
with this experiences gathered from the construction and operation of other platforms would be helpful to shape this development within
the context of envriplus anaee is particularly interested in participating in the work on identification and citation and on cataloguing
as these are of fairly immediate concern to their infrastructure consequentially it would be useful to synchronise their approach with
other ris processing is of some interest as well in particular the interoperability between models and data and the quality
control of data produced by platforms generic information about eiscat 3d eiscat 3d is research infrastructure that will use new
generation of phased array radars to study the earth middle atmosphere ionospheric incoherent scatter and objects in space contributing to
near earth space environment research it aims at establishing system of distributed phased array radars the system will enable comprehensive
three dimensional observations of ionospheric parameters and atmospheric dynamics above northern fenno scandinavia which is an important location for research
on coupling between space and the polar atmosphere33 eiscat 3d will produce about petabytes of data each year and aims
at using standard systems for data storage and cataloguing user authentication identification and citation of datasets eiscat 3d expects envriplus
to help them ensure that the tools that they select are well documented and open in order to minimise the
risk of lock in to proprietary systems define workflows for data and ensure interoperability with other ris and instruments via
virtual observatories generic information about elixir elixir is european infrastructure for biological information that unites europe leading life science organisations
in managing and safeguarding the massive amounts of data being generated every day by publicly funded research it is pan
european research infrastructure for biological information34 elixir will provide the facilities necessary for life science researchers from bench biologists to
chemo informaticians to make the most of our rapidly growing store of information about living systems which is the foundation
on which our understanding of life is built by participating in envriplus elixir would like to establish closer collaboration with
environmental research infrastructures ris and improve their access to life science data an enhanced interaction better insight into data structures
and relevant data standards widely adopted across environmental ris can facilitate an effective evaluation of areas of collaboration for development
of new tools services and training ultimately this can lead to better interoperability and discoverability of environmental and life science
data by users across atmospheric marine solid earth and biosphere domains generic information about embrc embrc european marine biological resource
centre is distributed european ri which is set up to become the major ri for marine biological research covering everything
from basic biology marine model organisms biomedical applications biotechnological applications environmental data ecology etc having successfully completed year preparatory phase
it is now in its implementation phase and operation is planned to start in the main purpose of embrc is
to promote marine biological science and the application of marine experimental models in mainstream research by providing the facilities lab
space equipment electron microscopes real time pcr machines crystallography lab equipment equipment for accessing the environments such as research vessels
scientific divers rovs etc expertise and biological resources that are necessary for carrying out biological research in what concerns data
the role of embrc is to generate and make it available it does not usually do any analysis of those
data unless it is contracted to do so data is usually generated through sensors in site in the sea or
samples that are collected and then measured in the lab embrc would like to achieve several objectives through participation to
envriplus establishing collaborations with the environmental community which would benefit from their environmental and ecological data developing and learning about
new standards and best practices in terms of standards developing new standards within inspire which can be used for other
datasets exploring new data workflows which make use of marine biological and ecological data networking with other ris generic information
about emso emso the european multidisciplinary seafloor water column observatory is large scale european research infrastructure in the field of
environmental sciences for integrating data gathered from range of ocean observatories it tries to ensure open access to those data
for academic researchers36 emso is based on european scale distributed research infrastructure of seafloor observatories with the basic scientific objective
of long term monitoring mainly in real time of environmental processes related to the interaction between the geosphere biosphere and
hydrosphere including natural hazards it is presently composed of several deep seafloor observatories which will be deployed on specific sites
around european waters reaching from the arctic to the black sea passing through the mediterranean sea thus forming widely distributed
pan european infrastructure goal of emso is to harmonise data curation and access while averting the tendency for individual institutions
to revert to idiosyncratic working practices after any particular harmonisation project has finished there is notable overlap between emso and
fixo3 data some fixo3 data is provided within the emso infrastructure emso would like to obtain with the help of
envriplus better mechanisms for ensuring harmonisation of datasets across their distributed networks heterogeneous data formats increase the effort that researchers
must invest to cross discipline boundaries and to compose data from multiple sources improved search is also desirable currently expert
knowledge is required for example to be able to easily discover data stored in the myocean environment furthermore emso is
investigating collaborations with data processing infrastructures such as egi for providing resources for infrastructure side data processing generic information about
epos epos is long term plan for the integration of research infrastructures for solid earth science in europe its main
aim is to integrate communities to make scientific discovery in the domain of solid earth science epos integrates the existing
and future advanced european facilities into single distributed sustainable infrastructure epos core services taking full advantage of new science opportunities37
epos will allow the earth science community to make significant step forward by developing new concepts and tools for accurate
durable and sustainable answers to societal questions concerning geo hazards and those geodynamic phenomena including geo resources relevant to the
environment and human welfare epos would need advice from envriplus to improve the interoperable aaai authentication authorisation accounting and identification
system federated distributed taking already existing software and make it available and scalable across communities generic information about euro argo
the objectives of the euro argo are to optimise sustain and improve the european contributions to argo and to provide
world class service to the research ocean and climate and operational oceanography copernicus marine service communities38 euro argo also aims
at preparing the next phase of argo with an extension to deeper depths biogeochemical parameters and observations of the polar
regions the euro argo research infrastructure comprises central facility and distributed national facilities on may the ec awarded european legal
status eric to the central facility euro argo aims at developing capacity to procure and deploy and monitor floats per
year and ensure that all the data can be processed and delivered to users both in real time and delayed
mode euro argo would like envriplus to design and pioneer access to and use of cloud infrastructure with services close
to european research data to deliver data subscription services users would provide their criteria time spatial parameter data mode update
period for delivery daily monthly yearly near real time the relevant data are pushed from the ri to the envri
cloud the data may be converted transformed on the envri computation grid the cloud account of the user is updated
regularly with the new data provided above an accounting of data provision and data delivery is performed generic information about
eurogoos eurogoos european global ocean observing system is an international not for profit organisation it promotes operational oceanography the real
time use of oceanographic information and develops strategies priorities and standards which would enable its evolution at european level eurogoos
is not an ri per se but it has many members institutes from countries who contribute to an ri for
ocean observing39 eurogoos strives to improve the coordination between their different member research institutes another important role of eurogoos is
that of facilitating access to data for their community through participation to envriplus eurogoos would value learning about other european
ris and getting inspiration from them for deciding on the general objectives and services that they could provide at european
level from technological perspective getting recommendations about the design of their common data system including formats or data platforms and
data treatments getting inspiration from ris about ways to distribute the data to end users using applications which are more
focused in this respect generic information about fixo3 fixo3 fixed open ocean observatory network is an i3 research project that
integrates oceanographic data gathered from number of ocean observatories and provides open access to that data to academic researchers40 fixo3
seeks to integrate european open ocean fixed point observatories and to improve access to these key installations for the broader
community these will provide multidisciplinary observations in all parts of the oceans from the air sea interface to the deep
seafloor the fixo3 network will provide free and open access to in situ fixed point data of the highest quality
it will provide strong integrated framework of open ocean facilities in the atlantic from the arctic to the antarctic and
throughout the mediterranean enabling an integrated regional and multidisciplinary approach to understand natural and anthropogenic change in the ocean like
emso fixo3 requires from envriplus better mechanisms for ensuring harmonisation of datasets across their distributed networks heterogeneous data formats make
life difficult for researchers improved search is also desirable currently expert knowledge is required for example to be able to
