the current eufar european facility for airborne research represents consortium of european institutions and organisations involved in airborne research it
is unique pan european portal and network for airborne research infrastructures dedicated to environmental sciences eufar works to coordinate the
operation of instrumented aircraft and remote sensing instruments exploiting the skills of experts in airborne measurements in the fields of
environmental and geo sciences to provide researchers with the infrastructure best suited to their needs the aim of this test
case is to describe the processes within eufar infrastructure using the envri reference model rm to describe requirements and architectural
features of the infrastructure and serve as common language in communication materials to assure the continuity of eufar beyond the
end of its current project funded activity eufar is establishing sustainable legal structure an international non profit association under belgian
law aisbl the aisbl is suitable for multi national infrastructure networks and is key step to enable eufar to develop
more straightforward ways of accessing aircraft across europe and to develop more efficient use of the existing facilities the rm
will be used to support these developments the expected output of the test case will help in the preparation of

research campaigns some ris are built to serve research campaign those measuring anthropogenic climate change its impacts and the effectiveness
of mitigation many are used by research campaigns and some will initiate research campaigns to improve their effectiveness or efficiency
we define research campaign as co ordinated resourced and sustained effort to achieve recognisable research goal research campaigns can be
conducted both within single organisation or of more interest from the ris and rm perspective can involve multiple organisations they
can encourage independent rival teams to validate results as in the detection of gravity waves the anatomy and illustrative examples
below refine this definition and introduce concepts highlighted in italics that need to be understood in order to assess the
changes necessary to the rm the current rm will provide framework for discussions with ris and research campaigners to facilitate
and record that refinement research campaigns have and need long term stability thereby increasing the return on investment for ris
and the rm by considering research campaigns we may also expose additional commonalities some critical features of research campaign are
introduced below and we initiate the discussion as to how they may be accommodated in the rm terms in italics
are candidates for inclusion in the rm defining research campaigns and introducing their properties research campaign has goal for example
to better understand or better describe natural phenomenon often the goal will be so ambitious that it needs to be
broken down into number of sub goals that may be pursued concurrently or sequentially some of these sub goals will
themselves require research campaigns hence the concept is recursive research campaign will be organised its goal will be proposed typically
by proposer or proposers and agreed as significant by research community that includes intellectual leaders funders and publishers it will
be addressed by sustained efforts steered by research leaders who are supported by research organisations the leaders and organisations marshal
research resources schedule or direct effort and resources and identify critical issues which require focused attention quality controls are developed
and agreed particularly with respect to the criteria for claiming success typically multi disciplinary team builds with intensive internal communication
sharing and refining methods code data and equipment but sometimes with intense rivalry between teams which may be carefully kept
separate as part of the success criteria progress is reported in papers and achievement of goals receives particular attention the
information sharing among individuals and teams and procedures for publication and citation are governed by agreed and enforced rules research
campaigns can be sustained for many years more than to confirm the higgs boson and more than years to detect
gravity waves and some require global alliances establishing incontrovertible and convince evidence of the anthropogenic element of climate change such
longevity and scope provides stability in the working practices and requirements that warrants attention from providers such as ris technology
and supply and infrastructure services anatomy of research campaign many research campaigns develop and refine models of the phenomena of
interest they may use numerical simulations to expose the implications of mathematical models often with substantial community investment in building
sophisticated suites of simulation code and in establishing specialist facilities major hpc and data centres these simulation runs depend on
the collection and analysis of observations to provide initial or boundary conditions the global seismic network complying with fdsn agreements
they may be followed by analysis of the differences between synthetic and observed values so called misfit analysis the quantified
misfit then implies corrections that need to be propagated into the model such methodological patterns are pursued repeatedly for sets
of initial conditions and multiple observation comparisons until the model reaches stability or the limit of resolution in the context
being studied alternative reasons for terminating the iteration include enough evidence has been obtained or resource available time to guide
emergency responders is exhausted the whole iterative process may then be applied in new context where similar phenomena are believed
to exist or for new occurrences of the phenomena in the original context or both the frequent repetition of such
methods motivates investment in optimisation and automation of as much of each method as possible often by adopting workflow technologies
many research campaigns interact with governance and standards bodies to establish quality standards and to facilitate global collaboration these interactions
are vital the research often poses new issues that need prompt agreed response to sustain progress rules governing specific campaign
or task within it often include commitment to adopt revisions emerging from such bodies examples include ipcc for climate change
ivoa for astronomy and fdsn for seismology the agility of those bodies and the speed of adoption of their revisions
is often critical to sustain momentum and to achieve credibility effective output from research campaigns crucial element of many campaigns
is to convince identified decision makers to believe in and appropriately respond to the results this requires carefully tuned presentations
of the evidence and of the implications this communication also needs refinement and optimisation which warrants research investment particularly in
contexts pertaining to natural hazards or societal challenges this is combination of socio political effort preparing relevant citizens so that
they are aware of the risks and understand the available alerts and their interpretation it is also necessary to prepare
local authorities and regional governments as well as emergency responders in such cases so that they understand the information made
available during an emergency and there is joint investment in tuning it to match needs and capabilities this will depend
on mapping information to popular media channels as well as developing appropriate visualisations these are specific examples of the need
to go beyond the academic boundaries and develop information to guide actions and decision makers data driven research campaign patterns
an alternative pattern of research campaign elements is becoming prevalent as our wealth of data grows such research campaigns still
have similar high level goals and outputs but the collection of observations dominates the agenda then various forms of pattern
recognition are used over the collected data such as machine learning or citizen science classification campaigns29 here again refinement and
development of methods the pattern recognition techniques may require advances in statistics and advances in the machine learning algorithms or
in volunteer recruitment motivation and management once again the methods are often repeated as new data or new aspects of
the data are investigated hence automation and optimisation becomes worthwhile investment these two research campaign patterns interwork the second yields
observational input or comparators for the first or it exposes evidence that provokes the formulation of new models for new
forms of phenomena for example regular high altitude meteorological observations revealed changes in ozone in the atmosphere above antarctica this
provoked recognition that the ozone hole was expanding and led to an understanding of the relevant atmospheric chemistry and its
anthropogenic origin successful communication then led to global reduction in the release of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the substitute refrigerants hydrofluorocarbon hfcs
have www zooniverse org been found to have significant ghg effect and as result there has been recent agreement to
stop their use many research campaigns generate the need for data intensive federations dif see section of d5 preliminary view
of rm modelling research campaigns the significant differences between research campaigns and other research individual efforts projects etc is their
scale and longevity which imposes the need for more organisational structure and co ordination via explicit mechanisms and recorded rules
consequently the impact is expected to be significant in the science and information viewpoints to explore this further two tables
for each viewpoint are presented below table table the first in each pair table table table table contains the entities
that are needed by research campaigns the second table table table table the relationships between these each table has column
for concept name and column describing how it may be handled in the rm the tables are populated by scanning

appendix ideas to facilitate ris engagement this appendix contains list of idea generated during the third envriweek project meeting that
took place in prague 18th november for engaging the interest and commitment of the ris technical experts to the envri
rm this appendix is organised into several categories of ideas as follows primers tutorials and practical examples training consulting and
helpdesk support community building and self help tools for design interaction more directly with the ris kiss keep it simple
stupid experiential reporting and case studies focus improve the rm to make it more relevant primers tutorials and practical examples
easy to understand ôprimerõ for the rm to understand the basic concepts with practical examples òhow to start with it
simplyó easy to understand guides example based use of actual problems to illustrate more examples and use cases illustrations tools
linked to examples have detailed list glossary with explanations of terms and acronyms mapping the use cases to the concepts
of rm hold minutes conversation with rm experts and see how ri business or community ri fits in rm designate
some basic ôstarting pointsõ that allow users to see the correspondences arising between viewpoints for some core concepts without having
to tackle the entire model at once training consulting and helpdesk support consulting style training which shows targeted solutions training
workshops physical or webinars to introduce key concepts terminology and barriers workshop for discussions attend domain meeting to make sure
developments are aligned motivate the interest of the ri to the rm if time is needed from them they must
be convinced that they will benefit training program perhaps leading to certification supported from helpdesk ideally available develop deliver webinars
that help people to understand patterns tools etc community building and self help rm champions within each ri one person
with an understanding and experience meetings within ri staffs to discuss how to make it easy to get started make
it easy to find and express the issues for broad range of users online discussion forum google group to help
build community and knowledge base faq centres of excellence this ri is good at acquisition and curation so it would
be the poster boy for acquisition curation integration apply rm to an ri and gain immediate feedback from the group
when problems pop up tools for design use tool with options to choose for each viewpoint visual tools good example
visually enhanced on line share developed tools in github and try to converge to common code base share developed models
in github and try to converge to common models in addition to uml suggest to use less technical diagrams concept
maps to avoid the message impression that this is for it people provide ready made templates that you think cover
the kinds of topics they care about support these with tools use linguistic notation as well as diagrams good gui
plus case studies develop logic that is computable from the linguistic form of the rm develop visualisation and consistency checking
aids that depend on that logic and cope with scale focus over the integrated viewpoints people need to understand the
integrated whole from the starting point they are at and to be able to drill down create tools that allow
ris to build their descriptions incrementally based on some underlying model easy tool interaction more directly with the ris directly
interact with the right people inside the different ris carry out skills appraisal within ris to identify where and whether
system architects exist thus to establish contacts and or understand the gap sit lock the architects of different ris in
one room and collect their common ideas speak to the domain specific experts and not only to the computer scientists
find out where ris have problems with their current work and introduce tools patterns and procedures that will be helpful
kiss keep it simple stupid keep it simple and abstract details are for the implementation of ris focus on the
simple but fundamental issues set of basic ôlegoõ building blocks that connect with one ôsnapõ keep the documentation manageable to
read and understand for groups from broad background work towards clean simple structural rm with examples it should be inviting
provide as many good examples as possible of applying the rm in different typical contexts based on actual problems describe
processes aspects that are critical important to the people you are attempting to communicate with in such descriptions the terms
link to concepts in the rm but you donõt need to say that then develop dialogue refining what they do
and see how vocabulary and definitions develop provide step wise examples as technology will advance and examples will age decay
template with different colours for each viewpoint user must fill everything with help of online guidance compare with for example
dmponline tool as an approach experiential reporting and case studies ask non rm ôinsidersõ to report on their experiences cookbook
of recipes for common scenarios how the rm can fit with already existing components of the ris the atlantos project
case is very nice use case for this purpose similar to what dassh use case is looking at atlantos use
case is typical data integration example challenge that ris are facing in the near future ri are asked to offer
services on the aggregated data beyond search and browse explain different ways in which rm can be used to design
new ri when upgrading an ri or other purposes practical guide to these possibilities is important focus focus on the
appropriate interfaces and stop considering that ris have nothing in place invite the ri to design the interface tackle the
system of ri services push ris data and metadata on eu cloud infrastructures and build inter disciplinary operations link rm
with oil with help of b2anno service annotate while reading ri data management documents establish wiki platform of rm users
improve the rm to make it more relevant improve the rm from d5 d8 d8 consider that ri data system
already exists works and therefore focus on the publishing interfaces to facilitate interoperability with other ris make clear the functional
and non functional aspects of the interface especially for interoperation appendix envri reference model version november snapshot this appendix pages

uedin getting started with the envri rm the envri reference model envri rm rm exists to illustrate common characteristics of
environmental science research infrastructures in order to provide common language and understanding promote technology and solution sharing and improve interoperability
about independent development of research infrastructures leads to unnecessary replication of technologies and solutions whilst the lack of standard definitions
makes it difficult to relate experiences in one infrastructure with those of others the envri reference model envri rm uses
open distributed processing odp in order to model the archetypical environmental research infrastructure the use of the envri rm to
illustrate common characteristics of existing and planned european environmental research infrastructures from number of different perspectives provides common language for
and understanding of those infrastructures promotes technology and solution sharing between infrastructures and improves interoperability between implemented services intended audience
the intended audience of this document is the envri community as well as other organisations or individuals that are interested
in understanding the top level conceptual architecture that underpins the construction of such research infrastructures in particular the intended primary
audience the reference model includes research infrastructures implementation teams architects designers and integrators engineers to enable them to be able
to drill down directly to find required knowledge research infrastructure operations teams and third party solution or component providers the
reference model is also intended for research infrastructure leaders and service centre staffs the reference model can be read by
others who want to better understand the envri community work to gain understanding necessary to make contributions to the standardisation
processes of environmental research infrastructures document structure introduction introduces the motivation and background knowledge of the envri rm model overview
presents an overview of the envri rm against the backdrop of typical lifecycle for research data the envri reference model
is detailed description of the envri rm from the open distributed odp viewpoints perspectives conclusions and future work concludes this
work appendices are not formally part of the reference model they provide additional information that may be helpful and for
the convenience of the reader appendix presents the full list of the required functionalities that is the result of the
investigations of the common requirements of research infrastructures appendix is glossary of terms and consists of concepts and terms defined
throughout the envri rm how to read the primary audience of the envri rm should generally read the whole documentation
starting with the introduction and model overview such readers then should proceed to the science viewpoint and the information viewpoint
before looking at the com putational viewpoint it is not necessary to read everything nor to read in order the
tutorials given below are useful entry points elsewhere link to be provided we give detailed guidance on how best to
engage with the reference model for different purposes the leaders of research infrastructures and service centre staff may want to
read the introduction and background knowledge in introduction and model overview readers who have general interests in the envri rm
