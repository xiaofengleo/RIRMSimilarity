research infrastructures projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create more coherent interdisciplinary and interoperable cluster of environmental
research infrastructures across europe it is driven by three overarching goals promoting cross fertilization between infrastructures implementing innovative concepts and
devices across ris and facilitating research and innovation in the field of environment for an increasing number of users outside
the ris envriplus aligns its activities to core strategic plan where sharing multi disciplinary expertise will be most effective the
project aims to improve earth observation monitoring systems and strategies including actions to improve harmonization and innovation and generate common
solutions to many shared information technology and data related challenges it also seeks to harmonize policies for access and provide
strategies for knowledge transfer amongst ris envriplus develops guidelines to enhance transdisciplinary use of data and data products supported by
applied use cases involving ris from different domains the project coordinates actions to improve communication and cooperation addressing environmental ris
at all levels from management to end users implementing ri staff exchange programs generating material for ri personnel and proposing
common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating the socio economic impacts envriplus is expected to
facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single ris and at the pan ri level it promotes
efficient and multi disciplinary research offering new opportunities to users new tools to ri managers and new communication strategies for
environmental ri communities the resulting solutions services and other project outcomes are made available to all environmental ri initiatives thus

abstract setting the scene in environmental and earth sciences data centric approaches play an increasing role to study the development
of earthquakes or volcanoes for example one needs continuous observation of the surrounding geographic regions and their underlying strata in
order to obtain the data necessary to model various seismological processes and their interactions depending on the problem scale these
observations can only be provided by sources distributed across different countries institutions and data centres moreover such research activities also
often require advanced computing and storage infrastructure in order to analyse process model and simulate the data advanced environments to
support research research support environments are clearly needed to enable researchers to access data software tools and services from different
sources and to integrate them into cohesive experimental investigations with well defined replicable workflows for processing data and tracking the
provenance of results in recent publication zhao et al identified several kinds of support environments that must work in tandem
to support data centric research computing storage and network infrastructures provided via egi and eudat also called infrastructures is services
for accessing searching and processing research data within different scientific domains called research infrastructures ris icos epos and euro argo
for the environmental and earth sciences and environments for providing user centred support for discovering and selecting data and software
services from different sources and composing and executing application workflows based on them called virtual research environments vres virtual laboratories
vls belloum et al or science gateways sgs miller et al an early example is d4science candela et al and
the current trend to general vres vls sgs is exemplified by vre4eic in many cases these different types of supporting
environments often overlap with each other as shown in fig vre can be deployed on private infrastructures public clouds or
infrastructures as services it can be operated based on its own information catalogues or the resources catalogues provided by research
infrastructures in some cases research communities can also directly conduct experiments based on resources provided by ris in the context
of theme2 of envriplus we specifically focus on the three types of research support environment identified earlier vres including the
concepts of vls and sgs ris and their electronic representation as ris and infrastructures is based on the specific foci
of those different environments an abstract logical relation among them can be seen in the layers of figure envriplus is
by its very nature heterogeneous distributed enterprise for providing the advanced supporting environments for environmental scientists thus key feature of
any recommended route towards an architecture for ris for their own beneficial utilization and also for inter ri interoperation requires
the recommendation of common operations and cross cutting services identification of computational objects in the rm reference model of the
envri project provides basis the purpose of wp5 in envriplus is in providing novel envriplus reference model which should be
developed not only based on the existing envri rm but should also include the latest development insights from other successful
ris thus re examination of the requirements from d5 developed with the ris within envriplus is the start point wherever
possible matching with the developing envri rm these common aspects emerge from two directions the state of the art which
provides opportunities for utilization in envriplus and the requirements which provide the specifications of the services and operations needed by
the users of the envriplus ris the common aspects form key basis for the route to distributed interoperating architecture recommended
for envriplus providing the ris with an evolutionary direction for the individual ris to adopt best practice and for them
to become interoperable the development plan provides co design with the ris stepwise approach to achieve the architecture recommended for
envriplus figure figure layered view of the different kinds of research support environments and the role they play in ict
activities initiated by user communities method this deliverable relies on input from d5 defining the relevant state of the art
and the requirements atkinson et al however it also relies on discussions with colleagues in all wps within theme2 wp5
reference model guided ri design wp6 inter ri data identification and citation services wp7 data processing and analysis wp8 data
curation and cataloguing wp9 service validation and deployment and re examination of the envri rm for already defined operations that
can be used in envriplus it also relies on colleagues representing the ris in the various wps the deliverable is
aimed at the specification of common operations those operations which are common to several ris and which could with benefit
for interoperation and maintenance be standardized and cross cutting services those services which can act across many or all ris
and which could with benefit in increased range of services and reduced maintenance be adopted by all ris the deliverable
assumes that as key part of the architecture and following best practice in interoperating distributed systems there is conceptual rich
metadata catalog or consistently represented interoperable catalogues available to all component services this catalog or catalogues however implemented has to
interoperate with and therefore be superset of the service catalogs existing or implicit of the individual ris to provide the
interoperability required this technique has been used for many years in various domains building on earlier work the prime reference
is sheth and larsen although there has been much subsequent development and elaboration for assets beyond databases the ris within
envriplus are at varying stages of maturity with more or less developed ict support the ri and in particular with
independent evolutionary paths to date fundamental principle of envriplus is that if ris can share expertise in the form of
common operations and cross cutting services then the research communities benefit from better systems and interoperation the cost of ict
systems maintenance for each ri is reduced it is possible to interoperate across the ris so encouraging new research based
on multidisciplinary science the method outlined below follows well known engineering principles of identification characterization and proposition leading to integration
into the architecture and description in the rm wp5 the method is as follows identify common operations that exist or
are planned in all or significant number of ris this is aided by the agile use cases work and their
progressive description and characterization in the rm reference model characterize them to understand different features inputs outputs and parameters propose
common operations based on best practice deduced from state of the art that could replace or augment the existing ones
and thus reduce cost in shared maintenance increase ease of use because researcher using ri finds the same operations available
document the common operations as community recommendation after extensive consultation identify from use cases and requirements the required cross cutting
services interoperation mechanisms characterize the metadata describing data software components services users and resources at each ri commonly in one
or more catalogs define canonical superset conceptual metadata scheme to allow mapping and conversion between these metadata formats via the
canonical exchange conceptual metadata catalog propose the cross cutting services to be supported to provide the interoperation using the canonical
metadata catalog document the canonical metadata scheme and the mappings conversions as recommendation the aspects concerned with the catalog and
metadata overlap with wp8 which covers t8 curation t8 catalog and t8 provenance these aspects are related through the rich
canonical metadata catalog that interoperates with the ri separate catalogs and also provides information to drive the services for interoperation
envriplus ris there is increasing understanding of how to design the architecture for interoperation in heterogeneous distributed systems and how
to plan developments within that context key feature is trying to satisfy simultaneously the requirement for improved services within individual
ris and the requirement for cross ri interoperable services envriplus covers many heterogeneous ict systems in ris and by its
nature is distributed system typically user of one ri will do most of their research at that ri using the
ict system of that ri the ri but increasing numbers of researchers require access also to other ris thus in
addition to common operations providing reduced cost at each ri by standardisation and re use the second benefit is that
the user or workflow generated by the user finds the same operations at other ris when interoperating beyond services there
exist the data assets key feature of interoperation is access to the assets datasets or software through metadata these processes
for interoperation are discovery of assets datasets software workflows services persons as experts organizations facilities equipment publications white and grey
etc contextualization of assets ensuring relevance and quality for the purpose of the user action support of and later autonomic
construction of workflow to execute the user request over time it is expected the purpose of envriplus that interfaces for
user access to one or more ris will become standardized so encouraging not only increased utilisation but also interoperability this
standardization extends to common operations available at all ris and also cross cutting services to allow the end user to
initiate the same common operations across multiple ris so achieving multidisciplinary research at this point the heterogeneity lies particularly in
the datasets both syntactic and semantic particular software required for processing data collected by instrumentation particular software required for particular
analyses simulations or visualisations typically available metadata is domain specific to the particular ri holding the dataset when accessed from
another ri or from vre virtual research environment conceptual canonical metadata format is required which is understandable both to the
ri holding the dataset via convertors and to the end user working from her particular ri environment thus for any
assets not just datasets convertors are necessary between metadata formats given metadata formats then almost squared would be needed using
typical programmatic brokering technology where the conversion is hard wired into the software this technique requires much effort and cost
in reprogramming as metadata standards evolve however if canonical superset metadata scheme can be agreed jeffery and koskela this reduces
to convertors built as metadata driven brokers this is the approach recommended by rda research data alliance nativi et al
given the metadata mappings then convertors can be generated using the mapping as specification for data this demonstrated success quite
early in geoscience sutterlin et al with manual construction of the convertors from the specifications derived from the mappings some
attempts to automate this more generally have been partially successful skoupy et al convertors for software have in general been
less successful although automated re writing of software from one language to another has been demonstrated using cross compilers and
or interpreters3 the ris rely to greater or lesser extent on underlying infrastructures providing basic services of networking computing platforms
data storage facilities and open access to research publications examples are geant prace egi eudat openaire and the emerging eosc
european open science cloud most ris also have their own computing platforms which provide some or all of the services
outlined above many also have access to networks of equipment sensors detectors with appropriate processing currently many ris within envriplus
have an existing or planned user access portal within the ict system of the ri some just have simple ui
user interface few ris are placed in an integrated silo with user interface portal vre candela et al at the
user facing end and tightly integrated facilities access to cloud computing at the infrastructure end this has advantages of integration
and potential cost savings for one ri but reduces choice and therefore the ability of the ri to obtain the
best deals from suppliers inhibits interoperation because of silo lock in makes it more difficult to have fully featured vre
spanning across multiple ris to allow multidisciplinary research the types may be illustrated figure integrated silo accessing ris through interface
standalone figure simplified types of ris in envriplus thus user accessing multiple ri is faced with heterogeneity the portals are
of different designs with varying offerings and possibilities for the end user and the ui in other cases may be
simple commands or web page of hyperlinks there may or may not be api programmatic access to ri services an
architecture for ri to ri interoperation would provide an end user at one ri access to all other ris required
as if the other ris were part of her ri to achieve this it is necessary either for each ri
to be able to intercovert with every other ri the n2 problem described above or alteratively each ri intercoverts with
conceptual canonical superset metadata catalog or limited set of catalogues reducing the convertors to the conceptual canonical superset catalog provides
the reference local standard for interoperation and by matching and mapping the specification for the convertors required at each ri
to interconvert between the local metadata standard and the canonical standard and furthermore to be able to interconvert the ri
assets especially datasets each horizontal double arrow in figure represents the conversion locala to canonical to localb metadata format this
then permits cross ri query and if necessary conversions of assets such as datasets this architecture may be seen as
step away from silos and towards interoperation between ris figure figure user at one ri using assets of another ri
however for truly interoperative access further architectural step is needed making the conceptual canonical superset catalog ues physical in addition
to ri ri interoperation third party users not belonging to any particular ri for example citizen scientist or policymaker require
homogeneous access via vre virtual research environment or some portal system spanning multiple heterogeneous ris existing ri users could also
use such facility envriplus beneficiaries are participating in the ec funded project vre4eic which has the architecture illustrated in figure
the ec funded vre4eic project aims to develop reference architecture and toolset for vres and is working closely with the
other ec funded vre projects in the cluster as well as vls virtual laboratories in australasia and sgs science gateways
in north america each ri would provide common operations services as far as possible linked together by cross cutting services
whilst maintaining local analytical simulation and visualization facilities appropriate to that ri together with the domain specific datasets to achieve
this homogeneous view over heterogeneity canonical superset catalog or limited set of consistent linked catalogues is are required which interoperates
with the catalogs of each ri has superset canonical homogeneous representation of the heterogeneity of the existing or planned catalogs
of the ris has appropriate content to support the processes required as defined in d5 of course if the ris
all used the same canonical catalog format as the superset catalog but with content partitioned for their own domain then
interoperation would be much easier it should be noted that the canonical conceptual catalog does not preclude and indeed encourages
and facilitates ri to ri interoperation using already agreed metadata standards and interoperation processes it is meant to assist interoperation
outside of such clustered ris figure external user accessing multiple ris via generic vre common operations introduction the provision and
adoption of common operations across the multiple ris in envriplus would produce cost savings in development and maintenance provide the
basis for interoperation since the end user and her workflow would have available the same operations in another ri compared
with those at her usual ri ideally the operations are implemented as services with advantages for software development including functional
and non functional parameters within soa service oriented architecture however providing the services within layered architecture as illustrated above ensures
clear separation of functionality and allows ris to choose appropriate and vre services through clearly defined interfaces there are major
topics of operations curation identification citation cataloguing processing optimization provenance within which there are operations at service level and cross
cutting aspects to ensure harmonization across ris architecture design for ri development linking model for meta information linking and rm
for the common vocabulary the common operations and cross cutting services lie in the intersections of these topics and aspects
identification of common operations the work reported in d5 included an attempt to identify common operations the heterogeneity among the
various ris was significant and some of the software appeared to be somewhat monolithic rather than structured and modular which
is necessary to allow re use and interchange this made deducing the underlying common operations somewhat difficult characterisation of common
operations the work in d5 also attempted to characterize the operations that existed in existing ris that could be considered
as common operations the analysis both of characterization of ris and requirements was based on the topics of envriplus identification
and citation wp6 curation wp8 cataloguing wp8 processing wp7 provenance wp8 optimization wp7 community support wp15 wp14 there was some
divergence between consideration of ict systems for managing data collection through sensors and other equipment ict systems for managing data
in data centre including curation and provenance ict systems for data analytics visualization data mining and simulation ict systems for
managing the whole research lifecycle including management of projects project proposals funding cvs bibliographies etc ict systems for managing data
collection through sensors and other equipment this aspect is covered by wps at present there is relatively little commonality among
systems collecting data from sensors or detectors whether stand alone or in networks various standards exist for particular kinds of
sensor and ogc open geospatial consortium within its swe sensor web enablement programme has recommended sensorml4 but its xml representation
has been criticised since it is large although comprehensive this is consideration when ingesting data into ris ict systems for
managing data in ri including curation and provenance this section relates closely to t8 and d8 catalog but also to
t8 and d8 curation and the upcoming work in t8 provenance which has actually started already to ensure the catalog
definition is sufficient for the purposes of provenance it became abundantly clear during the work for d5 that the key
aspect for data centre operations is the canonical conceptual catalog since everything else depends upon it the recommendation is to
have superset catalog which interoperates with existing and planned ri catalogs the ri catalogs use large variety of metadata standards
including variants or dialects of iso w3c european directive or european recommended standards the most commonly used or planned to
be used relevant metadata standards are ckan comprehensive knowledge access network in several dialects but most commonly that of eudat
b2save b2find inspire iso19115 an eu directive for geospatial data discovery commonly through csw catalog services for the web of
ogc open geospatial consortium as the xml encoded version iso19139 there are many domain specific named standards especially in oceanography
for example that are based on inspire seadatanet netcdf widely used as standard in environmental science sensorml used as the
name indicates especially for metadata associated with sensor data dc dublin core from w3c simple metadata format of elements but
with various dialects and semantics several other metadata standards incorporate the dc elements dcat data catalog vocabulary from w3c based
on dc but extended to manage catalogs cerif common european research information format eu recommendation to member states used widely
for research information and within envriplus as the catalog format in epos bailo et al including interoperation via cerif xml
cerif can interoperate with most of the others mapping has been done and convertors are available and also with oil
ongoing work in the vre4eic project so it can be validated by the envri rm reference model it should be
noted that in other domains outside of envriplus there are many more standards an example from social science is ddi
should in future ris from such domains need to interoperate with envriplus ris for multidisciplinary research then their metadata characteristics
will have to be mapped to the canonical metadata catalog the canonical superset catalog or catalogues has to support discovery
contextualization and action interoperation with multiple metadata standards and be able to represent temporal information for curation provenance and versioning
the common data management operations on catalog are input or edit metadata directly input metadata via convertor from another standard
output metadata directly output metadata via convertor to another standard validate metadata by software including logical constraints using computer processing
or by user manual checking display metadata in tabular or graphical form set select project union difference cartesian product join
in inner and outer versions the relational operators acting on the metadata in addition the catalog acts as the mediator
for more substantive data management actions where the metadata record are updated or added to record the action these actions
include download dataset to location with or without conversion download software to location with or without conversion upload dataset to
location with or without conversion upload software to location with or without conversion the conversion is necessary should the target
platform environment be unable to handle canonical format at present the usual case in all these cases the data management
operation has also to ensure that nfrs non functional requirements recorded in the metadata are satisfied typically these include rights
privacy and security aspects as well as performance commonly recorded as service level agreements furthermore each operation needs to be
recorded in the metadata to provide provenance trace and curation records to be used as appropriate information for contextualization in
any subsequent request the user request to the catalog result in set of assets to be utilized to satisfy the
user request the user can manually assemble the assets into workflow but it is anticipated that semi automated and then
fully autonomic workflow construction can be achieved this implies several more common operations assemble compose workflow this is complex involving
not only software and datasets but also platforms for computing and perhaps access to sensors furthermore the nfrs relevant to
the whole workflow have to be respected validate workflow confirm with the user that the request intent is satisfied by
the proposed workflow execute workflow including reporting progress to user to allow steering this includes moving datasets and software to
various distributed locations as indicated above ensuring the workflow serialization even over distributed parallel execution is maintained and respecting the
nfrs these operations all depend on the catalog for discovery and contextualization and also each operation has to record in
the metadata the result in order to provide provenance and curation information and to provide contextualization metadata for future requests
new data products may be produced new datasets and potentially new workflow specifications and these need to be recorded for
curation and provenance purposes ict systems for data analytics visualization data mining and simulation this section relates to wp7 data
processing and analysis at present the various ris within envriplus have varying levels of provision of what might be described
broadly as analytics the requirement is for set of modular services each of which performs an analytical function which can
be composed into workflows together with appropriate data and any necessary convertors to provide the end user with the required
result of her request monolithic analytics solutions while useful in particular circumstances do not accord with the interoperability and common
process philosophy of envriplus the required common operations are univariate statistics sum mean standard deviation median bivariate statistics correlation bivariate
statistics analysis of variance multivariate statistics factor analysis principal components analysis discriminant analysis time series analysis data mining numeric data
mining textual visualisation univariate graph with points visualisation bivariate graph with points visualisation multivariate graph lines with points perspective towers
bars lines simulation library of simulation routines representing navier stokes for composing for particular purpose of course individual ris have
more specialized analytical services already implemented planned or identified in the requirements of d5 ict systems for managing the whole
research lifecycle including management of projects project proposals funding cvs bibliographies etc this area has in general not been considered
by the ris within envriplus but user requirements for these services exist the provision of systems providing these services is
widespread in universities research laboratories and funding agencies in the research performing organisations such systems provide external facing information about
research activity including projects persons as experts publications and other results this information is used to create new partnerships with
other academic institution and with industry for innovation and wealth creation and or improvement in the quality of life the
systems also provide automated management reporting within the organisation and to external stakeholders including funders the systems are used to
measure performance and compare with other organisations both by the research performing organisations and by funders the information in such
systems is therefore useful to manage the research lifecycle and reduce the burden on the researcher especially continually reporting in
different ways to various stakeholders about the research typical operations are input directly metadata on organisations including an organisational structure
with network of units persons projects publications patents products and the relationships between them ingest via convertors from catalogs in
other metadata standards metadata on organisations persons projects publications patents products and the relationships between them export via convertors to
catalogs in other metadata standards metadata on organisations persons projects publications patents products and the relationships between them select organisations

etc using certain criteria part of catalog service query resource display in tabular or graphical form the results of the
selection part of catalog service query resource it is clear from the above that the envri rm is working at
level of abstraction higher than the operations identified from d5 and here condensed to common operations thus while many of
the identified operations can be imagined to fit within envri rm defined components it remains to be validated by more
detailed descriptions of the components and their properties on the other hand several of the identified common operations have no
obvious relationship to envri rm components cross cutting services introduction cross cutting services are intended to make interoperation easier that
is to enable user of one ri to be able to access other ris as if they were the same
as her usual ri there are cross cutting aspects to ensure harmonization across ris architecture design for ri development linking
model for meta information linking and rm for the common vocabulary there are major topics of operations curation identification citation
cataloguing processing optimization provenance within which there are operations at service level the common operations and cross cutting services lie
in the intersections of these topics and aspects there are several kinds of cross cutting service the basic ones are
move metadata with any necessary conversion from one location to another move data with any necessary conversion from one location
to another move software module with any necessary conversion from one location to another move workflow specification with any necessary
conversion from one location to another more advanced services are from ri or vre over one or more ris initiate
one or more processes workflow on one or more datasets on ri from ri or vre over one or more
ris initiate one or more processes workflow on one or more datasets on ri ri ri dÿ it is assumed
the target ris manage the interaction with the underlying is although the characteristics of the is must be known to
the ri catalog and if initiated from vre over multiple ris to the vre catalog identification of cross cutting services
at present cross cutting services between heterogeneous ris in envriplus do not really exist although domain specific metadata formats are
common in some groups of ris in oceanography permitting interoperation within ris there are some examples of services overcoming heterogeneity
among facilities and services of the included organisations within envriplus there is relatively limited expertise in simple interoperation metadata matching
and mapping provision of convertors and almost none in complex interoperation distributed parallel execution of workflows over multiple ris characterisation
of cross cutting services since few if any cross cutting services exist they cannot be characterized however the requirement for
such services is recorded and understood and the services are listed above the key aspect is that they all require
superset canonical metadata catalog proposed canonical metadata scheme and mappings it is unrealistic to expect all envriplus ris to have
or adopt single metadata scheme each has chosen or is planning to choose its metadata scheme for its own particular
purposes the envriplus metadata scheme therefore has to be superset of existing and planned metadata standards used in ri catalogs
have mappings and convertors from and to those metadata standards have formal syntax to assure integrity and correct machine processing
have declared multilingual semantics to allow validation and to provide cross walking between term sets in ontologies thesauri or dictionaries
be capable of describing not only datasets but also software workflows services and computing platforms including sensors detectors equipment related
to organisations and persons meting these requirements would require considerable development of metadata standards such as dc dcat ckan or
inspire as indicated above cerif can meet these requirements jeffery et al and of course other metadata standards could be
extended to do so proposed envriplus cross cutting services and relationship to envri rm operation identified for envriplus operation in
envri rm move metadata with any necessary conversion from one location to another data transfer service and data transporter but
needs also convertors unless within process data where it not defined in detail move data with any necessary conversion from
one location to another data transfer service and data transporter but needs also convertors unless within process data where it
not defined in detail move software module with any necessary conversion from one location to another data transfer service and
data transporter but needs also convertors unless within process data where it not defined in detail move workflow specification with
any necessary conversion from one location to another data transfer service and data transporter but needs also convertors unless within
process data where it not defined in detail from ri or vre over one or more ris initiate one or
more processes workflow on one or more datasets on ri coordination service processing service from ri or vre over one
or more ris initiate one or more processes workflow on one or more datasets on ri ri ri dÿ coordination
service processing service it is clear from the above that the envri rm is working at level of abstraction higher
than the operations identified from d5 and here condensed to common operations thus while many of the identified operations can
be imagined to fit within envri rm defined components it remains to be validated by more detailed descriptions of the
components and their properties recommendations introduction the recommendations define the actions to be pursued in the remainder of the envriplus
project and beyond provision of services it is clear from the requirements and state of the art analysis d5 and
the analyses above that most ris do not have the full range of services required by their users most ris
do not have the services required for interoperation cross cutting services many of the services were already specified at rather
abstract level in the envri rm many of the services required were not specified or not specified in sufficient detail
in the envri rm this implies that the envri rm needs to be developed to further level of detail to
match with the common and cross cutting operations emerging from the requirements and state of the art analysis of d5
metadata it is clear that the canonical metadata catalog or catalogues to assist interoperation across ris is an essential component
it has to be able not only to describe for discovery contextualization and action the ri assets such as datasets
software components workflows persons experts organisations but also the nfrs associated with them the choice of or development of an
appropriate superset canonical metadata format or formats is critical to the success of envriplus network of data managers and developers
envriplus has already de facto network of data managers and developers at the various ris however at present each ri
has its own philosophy of purpose its own processes and procedures its own governance its own characteristic datasets and software
and its own computing platforms with or without sensors detectors instruments the agile use case activities are highlighting the aspects
that are common and those specialized to one ri progressively these are being described in the rm in formal way
allowing logic operations deduction and induction to aid reasoning also there is some turnover of staff and so the way
in which particular ri operates has to be communicated thorough induction and training activities and novel ideas from the new
staff have to be assessed and if necessary carried forward this means that the plan has to include familiarization with
an agreement on the common superset catalog operations and cross cutting services their development their deployment including maintenance and upgrades
mechanism for dealing with new proposals for upgrading the components of the envriplus environment plan the plan was developed to
guide the activities in theme but co design with the it representatives of the ris has always been envisaged clearly
ris requirements will evolve and the co design approach should ensure the theme activities run parallel to those changing requirements
the plan was developed with assistance from the rm which focused views on the common problems and guided the discussion
on the architectural design required however the plan needs to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the evolving requirements of the
ris familiarisation m19 m24 set of training activities will be developed and disseminated to assist data managers and developers familiarize
with envriplus concepts architecture and development requirements the training will be based on this deliverable and will be highly interactive
to ensure engagement with the ris development m19 m30 the list of operations that are common and to be developed
will be prioritised not least because there are some dependencies the development activity will follow the agile methodology with short
sprints and small teams with it people drawn from various ris working together deployment as prototype m30 m33 the common
services will be deployed first as prototype at testbed ri and once demonstrated ris will be invited to evolve their
existing architecture and operations to adopt and utilize the common envriplus set of common and cross cutting services for some
ris this activity will extend beyond the end of the project upgrading mechanism m30 m36 in order to ensure the
software supporting the operations is current an upgrading mechanism will be developed and implemented this will involve identification of new
common cross cutting operations from novel requirements prioritization and approval for development software development to support the operation followed by
testing implementation in the testbed ri then adopted across ris in envriplus conclusions following an analysis of state of the
art and requirements d5 using agile groups there has been at and between envri meetings discussions with other wps especially
within theme the characterisation of the ris using the rm has provided formal basis for description and analysis the key
features to emerge are importance of the conceptual canonical rich metadata catalog the definition of common operations and specialized operations
to particular ris to be encoded within soa as services and the definition of cross cutting services including convertors for
metadata and ri assets such as datasets and software components again to be encoded within soa as services impact on
the project the main motivation of envriplus is to enable researchers to access utilize and interoperate across multiple ris in
the environmental domain the provision of common operations and cross cutting services is vital to this objective the use of
rich superset canonical metadata format is required not only to provide the required access and utilization of the assets across
multiple ris but also to ensure the nfrs and governance aspects are managed appropriately impact on stakeholders the development and
deployment of common operations and cross cutting services will enable stakeholders to meet their requirements for interoperation across multiple ris
