earth system research infrastructures projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create more coherent interdisciplinary and interoperable cluster
of environmental research infrastructures across europe it is driven by three overarching goals promoting cross fertilization between infrastructures implementing innovative
concepts and devices across ris and facilitating research and innovation in the field of environment for an increasing number of
users outside the ris envriplus aligns its activities to core strategic plan where sharing multi disciplinary expertise will be most
effective the project aims to improve earth observation monitoring systems and strategies including actions to improve harmonization and innovation and
generate common solutions to many shared information technology and data related challenges it also seeks to harmonize policies for access
and provide strategies for knowledge transfer amongst ris envriplus develops guidelines to enhance transdisciplinary use of data and data products
supported by applied use cases involving ris from different domains the project coordinates actions to improve communication and cooperation addressing
environmental ris at all levels from management to end users implementing ri staff exchange programs generating material for ri personnel
and proposing common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating the socio economic impacts envriplus is
expected to facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single ris and at the pan ri level
it promotes efficient and multi disciplinary research offering new opportunities to users new tools to ri managers and new communication
strategies for environmental ri communities the resulting solutions services and other project outcomes are made available to all environmental ri
initiatives thus contributing to the development of coherent european ri ecosystem table of contents abstract document amendment procedure terminology project

project description of work wp6 inter ri data identification and citation services will focus on implementing data tracing and citation
functionalities in environmental ris and develop tools for the ris if they are not otherwise available in close cooperation with
the successful consortia in call einfra the overarching objective of this work package therefore is to improve the efficiency of
data identification and citation by providing convenient effective and interoperable identifier management and citation services environmental research infrastructures are often
built on large number of distributed observational or experimental sites run by hundreds of scientists and technicians financially supported and
administrated by large number of institutions if this data is shared under an open access policy it becomes therefore very
important to acknowledge the data sources and their providers there is also strong need for common data citation tracking systems
that allow data providers to identify downstream usage of their data so as to prove their importance and show the
impact to stakeholders and the public this work package highlights identification and citation in environmental ris reviews available technologies and
develops common services for these operations this task aims at implementing common policy models for persistent identifiers for publishing and
citing data moreover the services for assigning and handling identifiers and for retrieving data content based on identifiers will also
be provided this task will build on existing approaches datacite epic and further developments by up coming activities it will
be furthermore operated in close cooperation with existing initiatives research data alliance icsu wds and will elaborate common data citation
solution for the involved ris this task will take actions to analyse the latest statuses of these existing technologies and
business models in the mentioned initiatives and transfer the best and most common solutions to the ris data citation has
progressed during recent years and important steps have already been made such as the development of pangaea and data citation
services in the dkrz define test bed requirements for the software and services and identify conditions for operating final software
and services inside domain and among multiple domains promote the needs of environmental ris in the global context once the
ris have decided their prorities these should be addressed to initiatives targeting pan european digital identifier infrastructures as well as
global initiatives such as the belmont forum and the research data alliance the goal of respective agreements should be widely
accepted and supported model support negotiations on collaboration and contracts with important publishers publishers are an important partner in developing
functioning system of data citation there are different models already available journals for data description direct citation via doi and
data citation systems since environmental ris provide large amounts of important data they can efficiently support respective negotiations run case
studies with environmental ris that implement doi and get experience with data citation by implementing data citation systems this will
assist in understanding details and will provide valuable feedback therefore attention will be paid to developing case studies of existing
research infrastructures the respective ris should have developed internal data infrastructure and data should be standardised in way that makes
provision of doi easy optimize the identification and citation model based on practice the wp should be finalized by task
that summarises the work and transfers experiences and further needs to cooperating infrastructures thus optimizing the permanent international solution for
data citation carry out two use case studies develop full data lifecycle model for biological data linked to the standards
developed and promoted through gbif and the experience of emso embrc and seadatanet establish gbif integrated publishing toolkit for the
publication of data from the marine biological records journal and define workflows for the marine biology ecosystems research community to
facilitate the provision of dois and the archiving of data in compliance with international standards implement full and integrated doi
and related metadata system for icos as an example of distributed ri with very heterogeneous data and test citation and
data usage tracking models define policy models for persistent identifiers publishing and citation optimally reuse epic and related work on
eudat it will also expose the eudat pid service to envri testing and avail eudat services b2safe b2share and b2find

citation services for environmental ris projects to prepare an envriplus strategy to negotiate with external organisations addresses points and above
background in this chapter we define some key concepts and also put the report into context data identification and citation
why what who and how background identification number of approaches have been applied to solve the questions of how to
unambiguously identify digital research data objects duerr traditionally researchers have relied on their own internal identifier systems such as encoding
identification information into filenames and file catalogue structures but this is neither comprehensible to others nor sustainable over time and
space stehouwer instead data object identifiers should be unique labels registered in central database that contains relevant basic metadata about
the object including pointer to the location where the object can be found as well as basic information about the
object itself exactly which metadata should be registered and in which formats is topic under discussion see weigel environmental observational
data pose special challenge in that they are not reproducible which means that also fixity information checksums or even content
fingerprints should be tied to the identifier socha duerr et al duerr provide comprehensive summary of the pros and cons
of different identifier schemes and also assess nine persistent identifier technologies and systems based on combination of technical value user
value and archive value dois digital object identifiers provided by datacite scored highest for overall functionality followed by general handles
as provided by cnri and dona and arks archive resource keys dois have the advantage of being well known to
the scientific community via their use for scholarly publications and this has contributed to their successful application to geoscience data
sets over the last decade klump general handle pids have up to now mostly been used to enable referencing of
data objects in the pre publication steps schwardmann of the research data life cycle illustrated in figure they could however
in principle equally well be applied to finalised publishable data persistent identifiers systems are also available for other research related
resources than digital data metadata articles and reports it is now possible to register many other objects including physical samples
igsn software workflow processing methods and of course also people and organisations orcid isni in the expanding open data world
pids are an essential tool for establishing clear links between all entities involved in or connected with any given research
project dodds background citation the force11 data citation principles martone state that in analogy to articles reports and other written
scholarly work also data should be considered as legitimate citable products of research although there is currently discussion as to
whether data sets are truly published if they haven undergone standardised quality control or peer review see parsons thus any
claims in scholarly literature that rely on data must include corresponding citation giving credit and legal attribution to the data
producers as well as facilitating the identification of access to and verification of the used data subsets data citation methods
must be flexible which implies some variability in standards and practices across different scientific communities martone however to support interoperability
and facilitate interpretation the citation should preferably contain number of metadata elements that make the data set discoverable including author
title publisher publication date resource type edition version feature name and location especially important the data citation should include persistent
method of identification that is globally unique and contains the resource location as well as links to all other pertinent
information that makes it human and machine actionable in some sensitive cases it may also be desirable to add fixity
information such as checksum or even content fingerprint in the actual citation text socha finding standards for citing subsets of
potentially very large and complex data sets poses special problem as outlined by huber et al huber as granularity formats
and parameter names can differ widely across disciplines another very important issue concerns how to unambiguously refer to the state
and contents of dynamic data set that may be variable with time because new data are being added open ended
time series or corrections introduced applying new calibrations or evaluation algorithms rauber rauber both these topics are of special importance
for environmental research today finally number of surveys have indicated that the perceived lack of proper attribution of data is
major reason for the hesitancy felt by many researchers to share their data openly uhlir socha gallagher this attitude also
extends to allowing their data to be incorporated into larger data collections as it is often not possible to perform
micro attribution to trace back the provenance of an extracted subset that was actually used in an analysis to the
individual provider through the currently used data citation practices rda europe gede group statement collection this sub chapter is stub
and needs comprehensive rewriting the rda europe group of european data experts gede has started to collect recommendations related to
pids from number of sources in the scientific community including thematic groups like fair force11 the international telecommunications union itu
the doi foundation and rda and its working groups summarize these and use for the introduction add more details about
fair and force from fair force11 https www force11 org group fairgroup fairprinciples meta data are assigned globally unique and

larger than ipv6 and support an openly documented api optimally supporting accepted data models the pid record can be used
to store the context of digital objects bitstream locations metadata pid rights information landing page etc pid needs to be
requested as early as possible at least at the time of registration at trustworthy repository pid record needs to be
available pids are associated with collections which can exist of number of digital entities the level of granularity at which
pids will be assigned is left to the communities and repositories high granularity is recommended to anticipate future applications metadata
description contains the pid of the corresponding object the pid record contains the metadata pid to ensure at all times
that do context can be retrieved this can be compared with the reverse dns mechanism the pid record should include
an expiration date for the digital object even for digital objects that have been deleted the pid record should exist
indicate deletion and if possible point to the metadata record from datacite http datacite org for electronic documents and published
digital objects register digital object identifier doi which is handle with prefix and associate suitable information with it such as
citation metadata doi needs to be registered for published do and it should be associated with citation metadata conclusions from
the rda europe views about pid systems workshop https www rd alliance org sites default files attachment 20160901_rda_pid_event_garching_report_final pdf held
in garching germany september proper pid usage and support will become key for competitiveness in science and industry pids need
to be used by all parties dealing with data professionally to make full use of advanced opportunities pid centric approach
to data management access and use will open the way towards new and comprehensive way of data handling and finally
to global digital object cloud as generic non proprietary virtualisation layer international and national steps need to be taken urgently
to offer sustainable structured and mature pid service landscape based on quality assessed service providers to all interested parties only
such structured and massive approach will prevent ending up with unresolvable pid zombies pids are becoming essential across sectors and
communities for different application scenarios and efforts need to be taken to offer services across these sectors and communities setting
up and maintaining trustworthy repositories is key for structured data landscape guaranteeing access to data and its accompanying metadata we
need to design the required mechanisms for facilitating automatic data processing and build the needed tools now with high urgency
we urgently need to come to structured and integrated domain of handle service providers service providers need to ensure that
these two interoperable domains are part of one integrated landscape of rich services the pid centric approaches that are key
to managing the data tsunami require simple and clear messages for the users the data fabric concept and the pid
centric model this sub chapter is incomplete and needs revising the rda data fabric interest group https www rd alliance
org group data fabric ig html works on finding ways to optimise data intensive research important steps include defining core
components of data management handling as used throughout the data life cycle and then enhancing interoperability between these in way
that benefits both human and machine consumption of data but data intensive research poses number of challenges including the need
for good cataloguing systems that support fast discovery and retrieval of data sets based on complex searches machine actionable workflow
engines must be able to autonomously decide if given search result actually contains useful information if access is authorized and
can be achieved under suitable data license and how to optimally access and process the bitstream the allocation of persistent
identifiers to data objects is pre requisite but it is not enough to simply store the object location in the
pid record from the rda df ig website https rd alliance org group data fabric ig wiki df configuration pid
centric data management and access html summarize condense but the pid record should also contain the pointer to the full
metadata description see diagram below so that richer decisions can be made pointers to the metadata embedded with the pid
also ensure that the metadata record is not decoupled from the data record it is bound forever through the metadata
record of the pid to enable this kind of functionality the information in the pid record needs to have type
information with it and the definition of the type both registered and described in way that both humans and machines
can interpret the typed data the pid thus serves in essence as map or guide to both locating given data
object aka digital object as well as interpreting and potentially reusing the object as is indicated in the diagram pid
record contains minimal information about the digital object it references this can be implemented as links that are call by
reference or call by value in computer science terms if the former is true the pid record points to external
reliable information sources in either case the pid has binding role all of the pieces that go together to make
data object available and understandable over time have to be sustained so they have to be chosen carefully if this
binding model is useful to many it can be used on which to add additional components data information knowledge this
subchapter is incomplete verifiability and reproducibility the scientific process requires that it must be possible to follow in detail and
as far as possible reproduce all the steps of research project from data via analysis to information and its interpretation
to create knowledge especially in earth sciences it may not be possible to repeat observations under identical conditions or collect
indistinguishable samples but starting from the existence of the initial input data sets reproducibility must apply reproducibility of research requires
careful documentation of all the steps of the scientific process this includes keeping track of which data sets have been
used and their provenance which in itself presupposes unambiguous identification and careful metadata collection curation traditional systems have been based
on filenames and catalogue structures but this is not good enough instead persistent identifiers of some kind are needed there
are many different ones available see article by duerr and info from robert huber ch below and they can be
used for different purposes during different stages of the research data lifecycle we recommend using identifiers based on the handle
system http www handle net as developed by cnri the us based corporation for national research initiatives https www cnri
reston va us in the handle based pids are issued by several different organizations operating their own handle registries all
support common lookup service though the global handle registry ghr the dona foundation http dona net based in switzerland is
technical management organization that has taken over responsibility for the evolution of cnri digital object architecture doa including outreach around
the world one of the foundation responsibilities is to administer and maintain the overall operation of the ghr task that
was previously performed by cnri handles are strings consisting of prefix on the left and suffix on the right separated
by slash the first slash from the left if there are more than one is the prefix and xyz the
suffix in xyz for instance the prefix consists of alphanumeric ascii characters together with the dot as delimiter whereas handle
suffixes in general allow utf encoding the suffix of an epic pid consists of string of printable ascii characters for
disambiguation reasons epic strongly recommends the use of lower case ascii characters in the suffix because this ensures possible later
transfer of an epic pid to doi from http www pidconsortium eu page_id the most well known handle based system
is datacite which has been issuing digital object identifiers dois since xyzx somewhat lesser known is the european persistent identifier
consortium epic http www pidconsortium eu which was formed in by consortium of european partners in order to provide pid
services for the european research community eudat http eudat org has chosen to use epic pids for all digital objects
stored in its storage services b2share and b2safe majority of the epic consortium members are also members of eudat and
its successor organization cdi https eudat eu news landmark agreement sustaining the pan european collaborative data infrastructure for the next
landing pages in strict sense he word persistent in the term persistent and unique identifier refers to the identifier and
not to the object that is being identified there is common misconception that once data item has been assigned pid
the item may not be deleted from the location that the pid metadata resource locator field points to this is
not correct as discussed by duerr et al duerr sometimes data are reprocessed using later versions of algorithms or calibration
that are intended to improve their quality commonly older versions of the data are viewed as obsolete and are no
longer recommended for future research since there is cost to maintaining data they may be deleted to make room in
an archive for data that may be viewed as more valuable identifiers should still reference the old data especially if
they were used in published works to preserve the persistent quality of the locator aspect of these identifiers they should
still be resolvable even if the data have been deleted this resolution usually takes the form of landing page pointing
out the fact that the data have been deleted and directing the requestor to the version of the data that
replaced the original one ideally the reference should include metadata which is typically much smaller than the data and thus
less of burden for an archive to maintain this metadata should include provenance and context information for the missing data
so that determined investigator might be able to reproduce the missing data if fortune allows it add stuff from starr
et al session pids vs citation pids but is it then really useful and meaningful to define large numbers of
pid records to data sets that one knows priori will not be existing for very long time but perhaps be
deleted after few months if it is does it matter which of the different available types of persistent identifiers see
section below one chooses for these short shelf life data and who should pay for maintaining landing pages for obsolete
data sets also called tombstone pages connected to the discussion around these questions the terms session pid and citation pid
have emerged bilder geoff bilder presentation layered services on top of pids rda europe training course workshop views about pid
systems garching germany aug sept here session pid refers to persistent identifiers that are applied to data objects that need
to be referenceable for example raw sensor data or intermediate data produced during evaluation and analysis processes that should be
easily and unambiguously referred to in the provenance record of finalized data product here for example pid from epic see
sections and would be quite sufficient conversely citation pid should be used for data that are publishable and ready to
be used for research purposes and therefore may warrant the assignment of an identifier that is associated with richer metadata
schema such as datacite doi data publishing the european commission and many other organisations propose the practice of open science
which can be described as including open access open data open reproducible research open science evaluation open science policies and
open science tools foster similarly to the open access for publications and open software for code concepts open data typically
means that data are open to use with minimal restrictions but it does not have to be free of charge
gratis to use borgman major difference between publishing data and research publication is that data are not static in the
way that published paper generally is data can be dynamic living and evolving by new versions being made available austin
publishing data could mean posting data set on simple website but often involves far more work than that such as
making considerations regarding data formats metadata descriptions and persistence of the data callaghan the benefits of publishing data include allowing
reproducibility of research increasing the quality of research creating new knowledge by combining data sets in new ways and to
make data accessible and usable to wider audience which could lead to more scientific publications austin borgman borgman the audience
of published data varies depending on topic and other characteristics of the research and the data and could include researchers
in the same field researchers in related or unrelated fields policy makers industry students and educators or the general public
the fair guiding principles for data developed by force11 describe how to make published data findable accessible interoperable and reusable
for potential users force11 findability means making the data possible to find by potential users by describing the data with
rich metadata accessibility means that the data and metadata should be usable in formats that are understandable by humans and
machines by adding machine actionable pids interoperability pertains to using metadata scheme that is open and well defined reusability means
that the metadata are verifiable machine readable and can be used to make proper citations force11 by following the fair
principles the of data can be fulfilled that data are reusable repurposeable repeatable reproducible replayable referencable and respectful bechhofer austin
and colleagues austin have proposed set of key components of data publishing figure based on their analysis of workflows in
repositories data related projects and data publishing platforms all within the work of the rdawds publishing data workflows working group
the proposed required elements for published data set include repository entry with pid metadata following standardised schema curation and distribution
the optional elements have three themes providing context such as documentation and links to articles and other research objects quality
control including peer review and improving visibility and access to the data austin the data workflow analysis austin resulted in
the workflow description found in figure the two most common types of data publishing were found to be submitting data
to repository and submitting data article to data journal focussing on the submission of data the workflow consists of ingestion
into repository process which includes creating pid for the data review of the data is also part of the workflow
based on the policies of the repositories and may include metadata formatting and host of other aspects of the data
curation to ensure the quality of data it is recommended that quality assessment procedures are available to users quality control
procedures for dynamic data are also identified as important due to more data being shared earlier in the research process
to ensure the persistence of data over time the authors recommend using repository certification system such as data seal of
approval and add that this could aid the data publishing process by facilitating collaboration with other actors involved in data
publishing including publishers the repositories and other facilities analysed generally used pid system in most cases dois and the authors
note that the importance of data citation through linking pids was generally taken into account linking data with papers people
and other research objects through pid systems is strong trend which was shown by the many presentations at the conference
on pids pidapalooza november in reykjavik the conference found common ground in the importance of pids for being able to
identify find and link resources and to reuse the metadata for published objects in other contexts this could mean that
the description of project and the generated data at the planning stage in data management plan can be extracted and
used to generate content to progress report to funders project thor see section xyz is an example of an initiative
to link data publications and persons through their orcids the persistent identifier zoo contributed by robert huber handle arguably the
biggest impact in the field of persistent identification of digital research resources was achieved by the handle system kahn and
wilensky the handle system describes minimal set of requirements for an infrastructure for the identification of objects in digital infrastructure
and how the identity of an object can be related to its location the system is agnostic to the contents
of the objects keeping it open for interoperability with future applications the handle system separates the identifier from the resolving
mechanism making it independent of http and dns the handle system supplies stable distributed platform for the resolution of identifiers
to urls including methods more sophisticated than http redirects like template handles and embedded metadata in our sample of repositories
listed in the re3data repository the handle system is used by repositories handle is mainly used by institutional repositories which
might be linked to the role of handle as an identifier in repository software like dspace besides the governance of
top level namespaces it does not provide more than the technical platform and comes with no obligations towards the persistence
of the resolution of identifiers towards their targets digital object identifier doi in survey of the re3data org registry by
far the largest number of repositories make use of digital object identifiers dois which were introduced in by the international
doi foundation are used by out of repositories the use of digital identifiers eclipses all other persistent identifiers the use
of doi persistent identification of data initiated by project funded by the german research foundation in klump et al doi
were chosen because of their already established part in the scholarly publication infrastructure the digital object identifier doi makes use
of the handle system and uses its namespace subnamespace doi distinguished from other uses of the handle system by the
underlying social contract in this social contract participating parties pledge to maintain the resolution of identifiers to web endpoints indefinitely
this means that identifiers will always resolve to somewhere in point even though the referenced object might no longer exist
urn the origin of the uniform resource name urn is its historical use as name for uniform resource identifier uri
that uses the urn scheme defined in in rfc urns were intended to serve as persistent location independent identifiers allowing
the simple mapping of namespaces into single urn namespace the existence of such uri does not imply availability of the
identified resource but such uris are required to remain globally unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist
or becomes unavailable primary advocates for the use of urn were the national libraries unlike the handle system urns do
not use common resolver system it is therefore up to the user to know which resolver system to use this
has been severe impediment against the uptake of this system urn systems were also primarily offered by national libraries which
offered great organisational stability to the system in working with data centres the national libraries showed difficulties in adjusting their
business processes to the requirements of data centres this resulted in an overall low uptake of url as persistent identifier
for data and only out of repositories make use this identifier system purl persistent url purl was intended by the
online computer library center inc oclc as bridging technology to prepare for introduction of universal resource names urn purl implements
uri concept it does not separate between identifier and resolving mechanism purl has no single global resolving mechanism and purl
resolvers do not communicate amongst each other and share resolving information like dns servers do purl has little social infrastructure
and formal governance in oclc withdrew its institutional support and the future of purl was unclear for some time purl
experienced severe technical problems as consequence the system was put into read only maintenance mode https www jiscmail ac uk
cgi bin webadmin a2 ind1511 dc architecture in september however it was announced https www oclc org news releases 201623dublin
en html by the oclc and the internet archive that the url redirection service on which purl is based will
in future be operated by the internet archive this move brought purl back from the brink of extinction in december
total of research data repositories in re3data org were listed as using purl and only few of them using purl
exclusively ark the ark identifier system has been introduced by the california digital library in kunze arks are currently used
by eleven repositories listed in the re3data registry it was developed as an alternative to schemes like purls urns and
handles the founders argued that persistence of identifiers is matter of service and reliant on the continued stability and support
of the service behind the identifiers initially the system was planned to enable decentralized resolvers however this principles never was
realized instead ark resolution depends on local resolvers ark issuing archives have to provide and central service called n2t name
to things which however solely resolves arks which are registers at the university of california thus arks rather represent resolver
convention and an associated syntax for the ark uri pattern life science identifier lsid lsids have been introduced by the
object management group omg in since the biodiversity informatics communities standardization authority taxonomic database working group tdwg strongly supports lsids
as the preferred guid technology lsids are now used by all globally leading providers for biodiversity data to identify organism
names lsids do not provide global resolving mechanism nor centralised provider registration the implementation of this standard is relatively complex
resolution is dns based and requires multistep procedure and in addition the associated metadata format is rdf consequently the technology
is controversially disputed hyam or page and opinions in social media tend to favour simpler identifier system such as http
uris in maintenance on tdwgs lsid resolution service was ceased and tdwgs support of lsids was heavily questioned by members
of the group after two months without central resolving system resolver has been made available at http www lsid info
however the discussion is going on and as parts of the biodiversity informatics community still feel uncomfortable with lsids they
recommend switch from lsid to cooluri guralnick et al this approach may however be fragile because it assumes that the
base url will not change since this is prerequisite for the operation of the system cooluris compared to the strict
criteria of nestor bütikofer and other related efforts cooluris somehow represent an anarchic view on identifiers similar to urn the
idea of cooluris goes back to early ideas about identification and location of objects on the web the idea of
cooluri berners lee is fundamental for the semantic web it is based on uniform resource identifiers uri which by proclamation
will not change they make use of standard http functionalities in particular content negotiation to enable the uri to be
resolve to different representations rdf html of the same object cooluris allow webmasters to maintain the persistence of their resource
identifiers the uris with minimum of effort and without centralised pid system advocates of the cooluri system reasoned that the
use of http functionalities is bonus suggesting that uri should be actionable as we said in our introduction over the
years this has proven to be unstable the main reason for this being the fragility of base url the result
of unstable base urls will be link rot on steroids there is already anecdotal evidence of base url failures from
the validation of xml schemas in long term archiving of xml documents by the national libraries the cooluri concept relies
on http as resolving mechanism and assumes that the http protocol will be around for long time http went into
operation in and on the timescales of technical developments in information technology we should not assume that it will still
be in use in years time identifiers for non data entities persistent identifiers are useful for many other entities than

the envriplus work package ref review was undertaken to map out and assess the ict and data management requirements issues
and opportunities of the environmental research infrastructures ris engaged in envriplus all in all twelve topics were investigated of which
data identification citation was one topic in the following we summarize the most important outcomes for identification citation that were
reported in deliverable d5 atkinson the survey questions along with the envriplus ris responses are available at the envri technology
review wiki site1 ri requirements data identification requirements add selection of concrete illustrative response examples here the survey found large
diversity between ris regarding their practices most are applying file based storage for their data rather than database technologies which
suggests that it should be relatively straightforward to assign pids to majority of the ri data objects profound gap in
knowledge about what persistent and unique identifiers are what they can be used for and best practices regarding their use
emerged most identifier systems used are based on handles dois from datacite most common followed by epic pids but some
ris rely on formalized file names while majority see strong need for assigning pids to their finalized data individual files
and or databases few apply this to raw data and even fewer to intermediate data indicating pids are not used
in workflow administration also metadata objects are seldom assigned pids costs for maintaining pids are typically not treated explicitly assignment
of pids to other forms of data such as continuous time series is discussed in sections data citation requirements currently
users refer to data sets in publications using dois if available and otherwise provide information about producer year report number
etc either in the article text or in the references section majority of ris feel it is absolutely necessary to
allow unambiguous references to be made to specified subsets of datasets preferably in the citation while few find the ability
to create and later cite collections of individual datasets is important ensuring that credit for producing and to lesser extent
curating scientific data sets is properly assigned is common theme for all ris not the least because funding agencies and
other stakeholders require such performance indicators but also because individual pis want and need recognition of their work connected to
this most ris have strategies for collecting usage statistics for their data products through bibliometric searches quasi automated or manual
from scientific literature but thus often rely on publishers indexing also data object dois note ris were asked to characterise
their designated user community needs but most responded with ri centric requirements this may be because there was not sufficient
opportunity to directly communicate with users normally their highest priority is to improve their productivity in this case by having
as much of the data identification and citation automated assessment of the requirements the identification and citation requirements are summarised
in section error reference source not found which validates the need for this provision in envriplus however the ris showed
significant diversity in their data identification and data citation practices and many were not aware of their importance in supporting
data use data identification and citation are however key to reproducibility and quality in data driven science and very often
vital in persuading data creators of the value of contributing their data data users of the need to recognise that
contribution and funders to continue to support data gathering and curation the next steps will include envriplus will consider programme
of awareness raising and practical training to alert those ris that would benefit and to raise the skills of practitioners
in any ri of the relevance of data citation and identification issues and some of the available technologies that will
help with solutions and rapid adoption of good practices the eu edison project2 has already worked on this for the
cluster project corbel for the bio medical ris the conceptual and technical issues in data citation and identification are strongly
linked with best practice in curation and practically linked with cataloguing and provenance these will be considered together in order
to provide consistent advice and solutions to ris key issue is adoption of appropriate steps in working practices where these
are exploratory or innovative the citation of underpinning data may be crucial to others verifying the validity of the approach
and to later packaging for repeated application once working practice is established it should be formalised as workflow and packaged
through good user interfaces so that as much of the underpinning record keeping citation cataloguing and provenance is automated this
has two positive effects it enables the practitioners to focus on domain specific issues without distracting record keeping chores and
it promotes consistent solution to be incrementally refined for these things to happen there have to be good technologies services
and tools supporting each part of these processes data citations being automatically and correctly generated as suggested by buneman et
al buneman similarly constructing immediate payoffs for practitioners using citation as suggested by myers et al myers will increase the
chances of researchers engaging with identification at an earlier stage many researchers today access and therefore consider citing individual files
this poses problems if the identified files may be changed the issue of fixity many research results and outputs depend
on very large numbers of files and simply enumerating them does not yield comprehensible citation many derivatives depend on computationally
selected parts of the input file many accesses to data are via time varying collections catalogues or services that may
yield different results or contents on different occasions generically referred to as databases some results will deal with continuous streaming
data often citations should couple together the data sources the queries that selected the data the times at which those
queries were applied the workflows that processed these inputs and parameters or steering actions provided by the users often during
the application of the scientific method that potentially influenced the result all of these pose more sophisticated demands on the
data identification and citation systems at present they should at least be considered during the awareness raising proposed above in
due course those advanced aspects that would prove useful to one or more of the ri communities should be further
analysed and supported this is revisited in the technology review section error reference source not found and in section error
reference source not found conclusion the use of persistent and unique identifiers for both data and metadata objects throughout the
entire data life cycle needs to be encouraged by providing training and best use cases there is strong support for
promoting credit to data collectors through standards of data citation supporting adding specific sub setting information to basic doi based
reference demonstrating that this can be done easily and effectively and that data providers can trust that such citations will
be made will be priority as it will lead to adoption and improvement of citation practices technology review add some
sentences describing how the tech review was done plus give reference to the d5 document it is important to keep
in mind that there are many different actors involved in data identification and citation data producers ris agencies individuals data
centres community repositories university libraries global or regional data centres publishers specialised on data or with traditional focus and data
users diverse ecosystem from scientists experts to stakeholders and members of the public technologies should reflect needs and requirements for
all of these here the focus is on ris that typically involve all of those viewpoints time constants for changing
old practices and habits can be very long especially if they are embedded in established cultures or when capital investment
is required for these reasons updating or implementing totally new technology alone does not improve usage performance as the behaviour
of the designated scientific community will influence the discoverability and ease of reuse of research data scientific traditions and previous
investments into soft or hardware can lead to large time constants for change adopting new database technology quickly could on
paper provide large benefits to the data providers like lower costs and easier administration and curation but may de facto
be unacceptably lowering overall productivity for significant parts of the user community over long period of time while the transition
is achieved two to five year analysis of state of the art and trends as evident from the large number
of on going initiatives for applying identifiers to and subsequently providing linkages between all components of research from individual observation
values to the people making them it is very difficult task to even try to envisage how the data intensive
research landscape will look in few years from now here we list some of the issues and ideas that are
being worked on now and which we feel will continue to be of importance in the coming years majority of
starting up ris adapt data curation strategies that are fully capable of handling dynamic data both versioned static files and
truly dynamic databases centred around persistent identifiers for both data metadata objects and queries standards for unambiguous referencing of subsets
of data sets in citations and in workflow contexts will become widely adopted by scientists and publishers alike enabling both
efficient human and machine extraction of slices of data as well as detailed micro attribution of the producers of the
data subset more complex data objects will become common including data collections research objects containing both data and related metadata
and other virtual aggregates of research information from multitude of sources this will require new strategies for content management and
identification at both producer and user level systems for allocating persistent identifiers will become more user friendly by development of
apis and human oriented uis that are common to all major identifier registries this will have profound positive impacts on
the administration and reproducibility of scientific workflows to enable efficient automation of data discovery and processing it will become common
to store an enhanced set of metadata about the objects directly in the pid registries data bases related to fixity
versioning basic provenance and citation the current trend to implement an ever tighter automated information exchange between publishers data repositories
and data producers will continue and become the norm in many fields including environmental and earth sciences more effective usage
tracking and analysis systems that harvest citation information not only from academic literature but from wide range of sources will
be developed individual envriplus ris are engaged in number of the above mentioned developments through the activities outlined in the
description of work of several work packages in themes and there is also active participation by individual envriplus ris in
projects such as eudat2020 or as use cases in rda groups however the relatively short lifetimes and limited number of
members of this type of project often has several negative consequences firstly there may not be enough diversity within the
use cases to encourage the development of broad solutions that cover the needs and requirements of wider range of communities
secondly the knowledge and experience gained through such work often ends up benefiting only small number of ris if there
is any long lasting application at all envriplus could therefore make difference by setting up platform for informing practitioners about
on going initiatives especially those that involve envriplus members but not as part of envriplus itself collection of ri use
cases for passing on to the technology developers and finally promoting the dissemination implementation and uptake of effective examples details
underpinning the two to five year analysis in this section we present more background for the topics listed above for
each topic some specific examples of relevant technologies are listed together with brief narrative discussion and suggestions for further reading
either links to the bibliography or to organisations whose web site addresses are listed under majority of starting up ris
adapt data curation strategies that are fully capable of handling dynamic data both versioned static files and truly dynamic databases
centred around persistent identifiers for both data metadata objects and queries main technology needs versionable databases to support time machine
retrieval of large datasets also sensor data that are dynamic sources rauber and personal communications with asmi there exist already
today several different technical database solutions that support versioning of database records both sql and nosql based both approaches have
advantages and disadvantages but with optimised and well planned schemas for storing all transactions and their associated timestamps it is
possible to achieve time machine like extraction of data and metadata as they existed at any given time without significant
losses in performance at least for moderately sized databases but challenges remain for databases required to store long time series
of high frequency sensor data for data stored as flat files it is mainly the metadata that must be stored
in database supporting versioning database to allow identification of what file represent the current state of the data at given
point in time connections to cataloguing and maintenance of provenance records supporting automated metadata extraction and production for machine actionable
workflows sources tilmes duerr see example in the article supplement on going work in rda metadata interest group rda research
data provenance interest group and eudat2020 work package in order for data driven research to be reproducible it is an
absolute requirement that not only all analysis steps be described in detail including the software and algorithms used but that
the input data that were processed are unambiguously defined ideally this is achieved by minting persistent identifier for the data
set as the basis for the citation and then adding details about the date when the data was extracted the
exact parameters of the subset selection if used version number if applicable and some kind of fixity information like checksum
or content fingerprint optimally at least one of the citation itself the pid record metadata and or the resource locator
associated with the pid will provide all this information in machine actionable format thus allowing workflow engines to check the
validity and applicability of the data of interest currently majority of the envriplus ris and their intended user communities haven
yet started to implement the outlined practices in consistent manner as consequence the reproducibility of research based on data from
these ris could be called into question what is needed to change this situation are good examples and demonstrators that
can be easily adopted by the ris without much investment in time and software such best practices need to be
developed in cooperation across the work packages of theme standards for unambiguous referencing of subsets of data sets in citations
and in workflow contexts will become widely adopted by scientists and publishers alike allowing both efficient human and machine extraction
of slices of data as well as detailed micro attribution of the producers of the data subset query centric citations
for data allowing for both unambiguous and less storage resource intensive handling of dynamic data sets sources duerr huber rauber
data sets from research may undergo changes in time as result of improvements in algorithms driving re processing of observational
data errors having been discovered necessitating new analysis or because the data sets are open ended and thus being updated
as new values become available unless great care is taken this dynamic aspect of data sets can cause problems with
reproducibility of studies undertaken based on the state of the data set at given point in time the rda working
group on data citation has therefore produced set of recommendations in steps for implementing query based method that provides persistently
identifiable links to subsets of dynamic data sets the wg have presented few examples of how these recommendations can be
implemented in practice but there is great need for continued work towards sustainable and practical solutions that can easily be
adopted by ris with different types of data storage systems more complex data objects will become common including data collections
research objects containing both data and related metadata and other virtual aggregates of research information from multitude of sources this
will require new strategies for content management and identification at both producer and user level systems for cataloguing and handling
more complex collections both of data sets and metadata research objects sources okfn wf4ever the rda data collections wg just
starting rda data type registries wg concluded with recommendations the increasing complexity of research data and metadata objects adds more
challenges firstly in contrast to printed scholarly records like articles or books data objects are often in some sense dynamic
updates due to re analysis or discovered errors or new data are collected and should be appended the content can
also be very complex with thousands of individual parameters stored in single data set furthermore there is growing trend to
create collections of research related items that have some common theme or characteristic in the simplest form collections can consist
of lists of individual data objects that belong together such as daily observations from given year similarly it may be
desirable to combine data and associated metadata into packages or to create even more complex research objects that may also
contain annotations related articles and reports etc collections can be defined by the original data producers but may also be
collated by the users of the data and may thus contain information from large variety of sources and types this
diversity is prompting work on providing tools for organising and managing collections using apis that are able to gather identity
information about collection items through their pids as well as minting new pids for the collections themselves there is also
need for sustainable registries for data type definitions that can be applied to tag content in way that is useful
and accessible both to humans and for machine actionable workflows however the use of data types varies greatly between different
user communities making it difficult task to coordinate both the registration of definitions as well as sustainable operation of the
required registries especially if these are set up and operated by ris here more work is needed in collaboration with
number of ris each with differing data set structures and catalogue organisations in order to provide clear recipes for data
typing systems for allocating persistent identifiers will become more user friendly by development of apis and human oriented uis that
are common to all major identifier registries this will have profound positive impacts on the administration and reproducibility of scientific
workflows adoption of common api for pid minting applicable across registries and methods sources duerr socha klump work by the
rda pid information types wg concluded and the rda pid interest group starting now although number of systems for persistent
identification of scientific publications have been available for over decade relatively few researchers are consistently applying these systems to their
research data there is at the same time pressing need to encourage data producers to mint pids for any digital
items belonging in the research data lifecycle that should be referable including also raw data and datasets produced during analysis
and not just finalised and published data sets surveys have indicated that the reasons for the slow adoption rate include
lack of knowledge about the existing opportunities confusion over their relative differences and merits and difficulties related to the identifier
minting process especially when it needs to be performed on large scale as often the case for data the latter
problem is to large extent due to the large variety in design and functionality of pid registry user interfaces and
apis and there are now several initiatives looking into how the registration and maintenance of pid records can be streamlined
and simplified however the proposed inclusive user and programmatic interfaces will need extensive testing by wide range of different user
communities there are also institutional issues concern over intellectual property rights may inhibit the adoption of working practices or the
delegation of authority to allocate pids to enable efficient automation of data discovery and processing it will become common to
store an enhanced set of metadata about the objects directly in the pid registries databases related to fixity versioning basic
provenance and citation handle registries also need to become federated and allow users to add community or project specific metadata
to the handle records see recommendations of the rda wg on pid information types including those required for identity and
fixity verification sources rda pid information types wg final new rda data collections wg presentations from the epic datacite pid
workshop in paris mainly motivated by desire to speed up and facilitate the automation of data discovery and processing there
are calls for the centralised handle and other pid system registries to also allow data producers and curators to store
more types of metadata about the objects directly in the registries data bases examples include information related to data content
type fixity versioning basic provenance and citation this would speed up data processing since the requesting agent workflow process would
be able to collect all basic metadata via just one call to the pid registry instead of needing to first
call the registry and then follow the resource locator pointer to landing page which data would need to be harvested
and interpreted some pid management organisations such as datacite and the doi foundation already support relatively broad range of metadata
fields but other registries are more restrictive the technology for storing the metadata is already in place but database systems
would need to be upgraded to allow for more pid information types also registry servers capacity to handle the expected
large increase in lookup query requests must be upgraded optimal performance will require the pid information types themselves to be
defined and registered in persistent way using data type registry the current trend to implement an ever tighter automated information
exchange between publishers data repositories and data producers will continue and become the norm in many fields including environmental and
earth sciences expanding the application of persistent unique identifiers for people and institutions in research data object management including metadata
and pid registry records sources orcid and datacite thor web site and webinar series driven by demands from large scientific
communities biochemistry biomedicine and high energy physics publishers and funding agencies there is strong movement towards labelling everything and everyone
with pids to allow unambiguous and exhaustive linking between entities currently it quite common for individual researchers to register an
orcid identity and subsequently use this to link to articles in their academic publications record this could be equally well
applied to published research data for example by entering orcid ids in the relevant author metadata fields of the datacite
doi registry record and allowing this information to be harvested by crossref or similar services connected with this is growing
trend to implement tighter information exchange primarily links to content between publishers data repositories and data producers there are several
on going initiatives looking into how to optimise and automate this including the thor project operated by cern which involves
amongst others openaire orcid datacite and pangea it is expected that the outcomes of these efforts will set the norm
however to be fully inclusive and consistent from data curation and cataloguing point of view this practice should be extended
to all relevant personnel categories involved in the research data life cycle including technicians collecting data data processing staff curators
etc not just principal investigators and researchers this would allow both complete record of activities for individuals suitable for inclusion
in cv but conversely can also be seen as an important source of provenance information for linked data sets more
effective usage tracking and analysis systems that harvest citation information not only from academic literature but from wide range of
sources will be developed discovering and accounting for micro attribution of credit to data producers and others involved in the
processing management of data objects especially in the context of complex data objects sources uhlir socha huber rda research data
collections interest group there is strong encouragement from policy makers and funding agencies for researchers to share their data preferably
under open access policies and most scientists are also very interested in using data produced by others for their own
work however studies show that there is still widespread hesitancy to share data mainly because of fears that the data
producer will not receive proper acknowledgement and credit for the original work these apprehensions become stronger when discussing more complex
data containers how to give proper credit if only parts of an aggregated data set or collection of data sets
were actually used in later scientific works indeed many scientists deem it inappropriate or misleading to attribute collective credit to
everyone who contributed to collection proposed solutions now under investigation by various projects focus on two approaches making the attribution
information supplied together with data sets both more detailed and easier to interpret for end users and providing means for
data centres and ris to extract usage statistics for collection members based on harvested bibliometric information available for the collections
the first of these could be achieved by labelling every individual datum with code indicating the producer or minting pids
dois for the smallest relevant subsets of data from given researcher group or measurement facility based on such information data
end user can provide detailed provenance about data sets used at least in article text the second approach may combine
tracing downloads and other access events at the data centre or repository level with bibliometry with the aim to produce
usage statistics at regular intervals or on demand from data producer however handling each file records individually would quickly become
cumbersome so methods of reliably identifying groups of files should be considered organisation of ri operated metadata systems that will
allow fast and flexible bibliometric data mining and impact analysis sources socha epic and datacite pid workshop paris make data
count project crossref openaire thor by analysing information about the usage of research data through collecting citations and references from
variety of academic sources it is possible to extract interesting knowledge of what subsets of data sets are of interest
who has been accessing the data and how and in what way they have been used and for what purpose
traditionally this data usage mining is performed based on searching through citation indices or by full text searches of academic
literature applying the same methods as for articles crossref scopus web of science sometimes also augmented by counting downloads or
searches for data at repositories and data portals however up till recently citations of data sets were not routinely indexed
by many publishers and indices and such services are still not comprehensively available across all science fields at least partly
this is due to limits in the design of citation record databases and the insufficient capacity of lookup services here
updated technologies and increased use of semantic web based databases should bring large improvements however it is important to cover
also non traditional media and content types such altmetric sources include mendeley citeulike and scienceseeker as well as facebook and
twitter indeed while references to research data rather than research output in social media may not be very common in
earth science yet it may become more prevalent where inferences from digital media activity complement direct observations in poorly instrumented
regions there are already examples from astronomy data are in any case already being referred to in many other forms
of non peer reviewed science related content such as wikipedia articles reddit posts and blogs since authors using these alternative
information outlets are less likely to use pids or other standard citation formats it is great challenge to bibliometry mining
systems to identify and properly attribute such references discovery and sharing especially of data contained in complex data objects may
be enhanced by the use of data type registries that facilitate subset identification and retrieval sources rda data type registries
working group eudat data sharing requires that data can be parsed understood and reused by both people and applications other
than those that created the data ideally the metadata will contain exhaustive information about all relevant aspects measurement units geographical
reference systems variable names etc however even if present such information may not be readily interpretable it may be expressed
in different languages or contain non standard terminology there is need for support system that allows for precise characterisation of
the parameter descriptions in way that can be accessed and understood by both human users and machine actionable workflows registries
containing persistently and uniquely identified data type definitions offer one solution that is highly configurable and can be adapted to
needs of specific scientific disciplines and research infrastructures in addition to the basic properties listed above the type registry entries
can also contain relationships with other types parent and child or more complex ones pointers to services useful for processing
or interpretation or links to data convertors data providers can choose to register their own data types possibly using their
own namespace apply definitions provided by others or apply mix of these approaches the pids of the applicable data types
are then inserted into the data objects metadata and can also be exposed via cataloguing services and search interfaces the
rda data type registry working group has designed prototype registry server which is currently being tested by number of ris
and organisations in second phase the rda group will continue the development of the registry concept by formulating data model
and expression for types designing functional specification for type registries and investigating different options for federating type registries at both
technical and organisational levels the adoption of unambiguous and clear annotation of data as offered by data types should go
long way towards allaying researchers concerns that their data will be misused either in an erroneous fashion or for inappropriate
purposes longer term horizon as discussed in recent report from the rda data fabric interest group almas both the increasing
amounts of available data and the rapidly evolving ecosystem of computing services there will have to be an intensifying focus
on interconnectedness and interoperability in order to make best use of the funding and resources available to scientists and society
tools and technologies including cloud based processing and storage and increasing application of machine actionable workflows including autonomous information searches
and data analyses will all rely on sustainable and reliable systems for identification and citation of data based on this
we have identified couple of likely trends for the period up to the year move towards automation of those aspects
of the research data lifecycle that will involve basic tasks like assigning identifiers and citing or referring to all kinds
of resources including data and metadata objects software workflows etc evolution towards more complex collections of research resources like research
objects that will necessitate more flexible approaches towards both strategies for identification and detailed unambiguous citation or referencing parts of
such objects much more tightly integrated systems for metadata provenance identification and citation will evolve pushed by data producers publishers
and data centres offering rapid and trusted feedback on data usage and impact summary of analysis highlighting implications and issues
tools and services now under development that will allow seamless linking of data articles people etc are likely to have
large impact on individual researchers institutions publishers and stakeholders by allowing streamlining of the entire data management cycle virtually instantaneous
