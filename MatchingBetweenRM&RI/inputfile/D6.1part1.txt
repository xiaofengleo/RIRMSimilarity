identifiers for researchers are now an accepted part of the scientific information flow publishing of data may not even consider
identifiers for other resources except for publications for which dois are well established to speed up the adaptation both current
and future technologies for data identification and citation must not only be flexible enough to serve wide range of existing
research environments but they also have to be shown to provide clear benefits to both producers curators and end users
indeed while some research communities and infrastructures have fully embraced the consistent use of pids for data metadata and other
resources throughout the entire data lifecycle many others are only beginning to think about using them important reasons for this
hesitancy or tardiness include substantial knowledge gap perceived high investment costs both for personnel hardware and software and lack of
support from the respective scientific communities to change engrained work practices envriplus is expected to play an important role in
defining best practices for first applying identifiers to data and other research resources including the researchers themselves and secondly how
use them for citations and provenance tracking this will be achieved by designing and building demonstrators and implementations based on
concrete needs and requirements of envriplus member ris and providing documentation and instructional materials that can be used for training
activities further discussion of the data identification and citation technologies can be found in section error reference source not found
this takes longer term perspective and considers relations with strategic issues and other technology topics services assessing the data identification
and citation technology review must be condensed extract most important points written by malcolm atkinson alex hardisty et al for
d5 section gives very clear explanations of the value of good quality working practices for identifying and referencing all items
of data that are or may become significant in research it highlighted two pervasive challenges faced by all those who
are engaged in stages of the data lifecycle or are using or producing data in their research or for decision
support one there are diverse suggestions but not agreed and widely adopted standards underpinning the necessary actions whether those actions
are carried out by humans or software two today there aren good tools and technologies that make it easy for
humans or software to perform these tasks efficiently there is great deal of work underway and we can be optimistic
about viable deployable support for data identification and citation becoming available within the next few years this poses another two
challenges how to identify and align with the software and methods that will be most widely supported and adopted and
how best to use the emerging software metadata standards and proposed methods in the envriplus context that requires developing standard
practices metadata and protocols that allow interworking within and between the ris and other organisations that is an issue prevalent
in nearly all ris for all technology topics indeed cataloguing curation and provenance all need to make effective use of
the functionality and facilities data identification and citation will provide conversely the work on catalogues may provide facilities for pid
registries with associated metadata scientists in each field will need to associate their identified items with concepts in their view
of the natural world terms for widely adopted agreed concepts may be identified by standardised vocabularies underpinned by formal ontologies
see section for such agreed concepts these external references provide identification and citation however scientists may take different views of
the phenomena they observe or they may be developing conceptual framework for new phenomena new species that they have identified
in this case they need framework for defining and citing the new concepts that they manage and develop presumably this
would use the data identification and citation machinery when their contributions reach acceptance or are published these localised identities should
easily migrate into the standard reference space of managed identities conversely if they fail to establish evidence to back up
their idea their localised developments will not affect researchers other than those they are currently collaborating with optimisation will interact
with data identification for two reasons both caching and the co location of data processing and derived data depend on
precise data referencing integration into workflows of the functions required for data identification and citation is crucial labour and error
saving step processing will then need to execute the data intensive workflows and call on data identification services the basic
consistency for data identification and citation should be achievable within the envriplus project lifetime see sections and but as in
so many scientific contexts this leads to further challenges in this case dealing with the more complex composite and time
varying data generated by the work of ris and their research communities see section finding ways of succinctly efficiently and
precisely identifying the growing volumes and many subtleties of the data used by and produced by future data driven research
will always be challenge as one aspect is covered increases in volumes increases in rates increases in diversity and researcher
ingenuity will pose new ones or break existing solutions it is vital to be on the ladder addressing such issues
as that is key to international research leadership and to addressing societal challenges there is clearly good reason to believe
from the understanding and insights shared in section that data identification and citation will be progressing well up that ladder
during envriplus there are further considerations that may be addressed in the future these are enumerated here in no particular
order many of them apply to subsequent technology review topics as well identification and cataloguing the relationship between data identification
and cataloguing is very close the identity record could also be catalogue entry for the referenced data the metadata required
for the identity purposes could be subset of the total catalogue metadata an operation possibly standard query pattern could yield
the information required for the purposes of data identification and citation it seems unlikely that independent development and support of
identification and cataloguing will make long term sense however there may be distinguished subset of catalogues that register data identity
and the identifiers these use would be used in other catalogues provenance processing and optimisation the principles and procedures for
minting adequate references would still need to be independently designed and agreed but their implementation would employ appropriate catalogue functionality
at which point non functional issues such as performance and availability would come to the fore harmonised solutions would simplify
interworking but they confront established cultures and investments roles for data identifiers it is obvious that cataloguing and provenance will
need reliable data identifiers to refer to data from their records it is desirable that almost all data processing refers
to its inputs in terms of the data identifiers this permits implementations to store copies of data replicated for availability
and preservation and then to choose the one with lowest contribution to the costs identified by optimisation as the storage
technologies resource provisions and data intensive middleware evolve if the scientific methods are couched in terms of data identifiers rather
than naming systems based on particular storage schemes the mappings invoked during method enactment can adapt to those changes hard
wired naming means everyone who is involved in formulating the method has to be involved in adapting to the changed
digital context clearly an unsustainable policy indeed the role for data identities in optimisation is much greater if data are
identified by trustworthy mechanism the optimiser can recognise when the same data are requested on two occasions in the same
workflow by the same user running different process or by different users and save work accessing transferring and transforming it
again raising the level of discourse the majority of discussions in requirements gathering and in technology review were couched in
terms of practical and concrete implementation terms such delivery mechanisms are critical but developing precise abstract models then clarifying them
through discussion and revision is of greater and long term benefit the reference model see section provides vocabulary and context
where such discussion takes place analysis and decisions couched in these higher level terms are much less subject to the
uncertainties of digital technology evolution those decisions tend to have rationale that is not based on the demands and issues
of the current projects or current equipment and its software rather it is based on the scientific and community goals
these need to be shaped and brought into as much harmonisation as possible that is easier at more abstract level
once the goals are agreed the mapping to implementations can develop and yield the best approximation to those goals given
current circumstances for example should the minting of data identity be an atomic process that is one that happens all
at once leading to complete and final record the requestor would provide the data and all of the information required
for metadata in one go the identity system then allocates pid and builds all of the associated metadata and makes
permanent record of the minted association or should non atomic incremental sequence of operations be supported for example either the
workflow requests data pid to allocate or sends the data and gets pid later the workflow can supply the data
and required metadata later the workflow can say that it wants the pid promoted to preserved status where it has
been quality assured or say that that binding between pid data and metadata should be discarded transient identities such incremental
approaches might allow internal identities for workflow intermediates and potential result sets to be allocated quickly clearly fixity is not
important at this time and costs of supporting it and other metadata would slow workflow many workflows fail or are
under development so their information should not be captured and curated but their intermediate data may be highly relevant for
diagnosis and for testing sub tasks during development what kinds of operation are allowed on reference can workflow or user
retrieve the data associated with it can they retrieve aspects of the associated metadata can they formulate queries on the
metadata that retrieve set of identities can that set be used to perform bundle of the above operations and so
on accommodating diversity although the campaign for harmonisation is vital it will never completely achieve conformity for two reasons there
are many external forces such as collaborative and global agreements that lock ris and their communities into different standards and
working practices and ii researchers and their support teams are ingenious inventors of new methods crucial innovation on which advances
are built we would not wish to inhibit this the former can be accommodated by offering functions that map sometimes
with loss of precision to common interchange form rdf triples conforming to the semantic web model berners lee is such
capability required for data identities and the operations on them the user driven variations can be accommodated by having some
fields in the data identity registry capable of holding any user defined material json format records rdf records xml records
matrices or plain text the ability to use this information in queries would then be required spinuso as most underlying
database systems are capable of accommodating such flexibility see below this is potentially feasible it is most likely to be
required as the designated community becomes adept at using the existing facilities hence we would not expect it to have
much prominence in the current round of requirements registry platforms it is necessary to build registries and other catalogues on
top of high quality database systems there may be more of catalogue framework above the database provided by the cataloguing
campaign see sections and that delivers functionality that packages the underlying database semantics so that for example the database delivery
platform may be replaced database engineering has huge investment and that helps address sustainability issues raised in section it also
delivers scalability by use of multiple nodes delivers accommodation of multiple data models handles nosql and sql distributed queries and
delivers mechanisms for high availability and mitigation of systems failure that might otherwise cause loss of data or inconsistent states
one approach to sustainability is to use widely supported open source projects such as some of those under the apache
foundation www apache org another is to depend on commercially supported software there are several good database vendors temporal patterns
are all of the registries or catalogues built incrementally for example many ivoa catalogues are rebuilt with specified periodicity this
has two advantages they act as stable referenceable data source for that period typically six months and ii redesign and
improvement of the catalogue building methods can progress during that interval and then be released are the visible registries of
data identities always built incrementally are they ever rebuilt what is the model for rebuilding them distribution patterns the registry
of data identities for particular community is almost certainly logically presented to them as single entity however is it in
fact distributed entity to handle transient and initial interactions locally and fast but to promote persistent complete records to authority
sites replicated for durability and availability is this recursive federation structure see section where sub communities within an ri pool
their data identities and group of ris then pool these identity integrations this may be more consistent with requirements for
autonomy it may also be easier from the viewpoint of incremental adoption however it almost certainly increases the operational and
implementation complexity it may be later adaptation but that may be easier if it is anticipated jam tomorrow is not
enough having visions of harmonised support for multiple ris data and communities and well planned path to deliver that goal
is important however it will be futile and wasted effort if the results are not adopted by the majority of
relevant practitioners the researchers the technologists engineers and managers who support them and the users of the produced derivatives experience
has shown that promising exciting advances but not taking the practitioners along with you leaves them finding alternatives to get
today work done once those alternatives have been developed it takes very long time and lot of effort to re
recruit the community consequently all of the important categories of practitioner have to see benefits as envriplus progresses they have
to see jam today180 this means finding immediate benefits for them tools that help with their common tasks data that
they want such as the usage of their data summarised and automation of parts of working practices and scientific methods
as soon as they become available made accessible to them this links back to raising the level of discourse above
as if we identify critical subtasks request data identity issue data identity present data identity to have action applied to
it etc then the discourse contains concepts that can be incrementally developed and can prove useful almost immediately their usability
would be much helped by linking with communities of tool builders the visualisation services in spinuso myers et al myers
identified the value of making the stages of curation incremental so that those stages yield benefits to practitioners as they
work they benefit from having some metadata associated with data in catalogue so they can find subsets of interest to
them and apply operations to all members of such subsets this induces them to introduce metadata terms such as dates
and significant properties because they are relevant for their current research campaign those same metadata will have been tested and
improved by the time they are used for curation training promoting best practices wide adaptation of persistent identifiers into the
day to day operations and workflows of envriplus partners could bring very large dividends but it will cost in time
and money spent on aligning current practices with what for many are new steps and requirements to facilitate the involved
processes it will be very important to provide relevant and useful information to the partner organizations by documenting and presenting
couple of success stories from different domains it will be easier to illustrate pid best practices existing connection channels to
external organizations pid providers here we will summarize the operations and features of some of the most important pid providers

right now that are looking into multitude of different angles envriplus needs to make sure that we are not simply
repeating what is being done by others thor project thor http project thor eu is very relevant to wp6 common
denominator is the university of bremen team which is involved in both contributed by markus stocker the technical and human
infrastructure for open research thor project and its partners play key role in ongoing efforts of integrating orcid in envriplus
ris thor is months h2020 project in its second year and aims at placing pids at the fingertips of researchers
such that researchers have access to pids for their research artefacts relevant to scientific workflows thor has facilitated orcid integrations
in disciplinary repositories at ebi cern and pangaea the thor partners pangaea orcid and datacite are key to our efforts
in discussing coordinating and facilitating orcid integrations in ris first teleconference between orcid icos carbon portal and pangaea was organized
on october the meeting was first attempt to bring representatives of icos as an envriplus ri and thor together to
discuss the idea of thor contributions to orcid integrations in ris there was strong support for such collaboration and shared
understanding of its benefits to both thor and envriplus and its ris we thus decided to present the idea of
coordinating orcid integrations in ris using pangaea experience and thor expertise at the 3rd envriweek the presentation was received with
enthusiasm additional ris have already showed interest in joining the collaboration specifically euro argo and ifremer following the 3rd envriweek
we now aim at further discussions and coordination on the requirements and challenges ris face in integrating orcid greater understanding
will form the base for planned thor envriplus bootcamp during which thor experts of orcid pangaea and datacite and envriplus
ri representatives will convene to develop solutions for the identified challenges the bootcamp is planned to be held in march
rda wds groups there are number of rda groups working on various aspects of data publishing their reports contain lot
of interesting and relevant points suggested system design for envriplus general comments specifically which type of persistent identifier is used
by any ri should be dictated by the needs of both the ri and its typical end user communities there
are many different options see section in general those based on the handle system dois from datacite and pids from
epic as well as orcids for people are at present the most commonly used by envriplus partners based on the
questionnaire the amount of metadata that is mandatory to provide at the time of identifier registration minting varies core components
persistent identifiers should be assigned throughout all parts of the research data life cycle this supports all the aspects of
the fair now fair principles namely findability accessibility interoperability reusability reproducibility all required in the new era of truly data
intensive research that environmental research infrastructures are entering into to comply with fair it is clearly no longer adequate to
rely on specific folder structure designs and or file naming conventions envriplus partners should strive to implement the use of
pids for all of the following categories data objects files databases etc metadata objects articles reports and other documents related
to the data people including everyone involved in the data production chain organizations agencies institutes and ris themselves involved in
the data production chain sensors and sensor platforms measurement stations cruises measurement campaigns physical samples in addition comprehensive use of
pids should be considered for queries used for accessing and retrieving subsets of datasets data content types software releases used
in the data processing workflows used in the data processing to enable this approach ris need to take number of
steps as outlined below for the different categories data the following applies to all kinds of digital data objects including
flat files file archives and snapshots of databases both relational and time stamped versionable types set up or subscribe to
repository service for safe and trustworthy storage of the data objects sign up to relevant pid providers epic datacite themselves
or contact national data management resource providers or data publishing repositories to do this on their behalf be prepared to
pay yearly fees for prefixes often also small additional fee is paid per pid costs procedures vary lot between countries
design workflows scripts or manual procedures for assigning pids based on restful api calls should include capability to provide ri
specific unique suffixes for each item should include capability to calculate fixity information checksums and store in the pid registry
implement the pid assignment at all relevant data life cycle steps adapt existing cataloguing systems to store pid information set
up system interfaced to the catalogue that can dynamically create landing pages landing pages should be interpretable both by humans
and via content negotiation machine operated processes and workflows landing pages should both link on to the data object itself
and provide all relevant metadata or at least links to where the descriptive metadata can be retrieved for data practical
issues like granularity and the data product level are important factors as well as costs associated with assigning pids and
maintaining their records however there are good reasons for applying pids at quite fine scales of granularity as this is
likely to greatly simplify and enhance the overall data publication process by allowing for correct citation of data accessed used
by researchers ii the efficient retrieval of usage citation statistics via bibliometric indexing agents iii the scientific reproducibility of the
extraction of identical data sets based on citation string including pid information iv the correct usage of downloaded data as
all relevant metadata is reachable via the data object landing page the annotation and associated record keeping of data items
provenance information vi the assignment of credit to all involved personnel and institutes vii the creation and maintenance of data
collections viii the application of machine based data harvesting processing and evaluation metadata metadata about data objects may be stored
in several different ways as separate documents in plain database or in cataloguing system especially in the first case it
is good practice to handle the files as data objects in their own right of course as periodic snapshots of
the metadata and or cataloguing system database are backed up and stored in trusted repository they too should be assigned
pid follow the same steps as outlined above for data objects note that ideally the catalogue entry and hence the
corresponding landing page for metadata object should contain information about or at least pid based links to all related data
objects in this way the relationship between data and metadata is completely defined articles reports and other documents related to
the data all articles reports and other documents related to the production of the data the dataset types or the
data from project as whole should be published either in data publication journal or as separate documents on zenodo figshare
or similar repository site this will ensure that the documents will be assigned datacite doi and thus be easily citable
this category also covers images and audiovisual content that describe the data production analysis or general context of the data
collection people including everyone involved in the data production chain all personnel involved in the ri data production activities should
register at orcid to receive their own individual identifier if possible and allowed by the ri data publishing workflow coupling
should be made between data set being published and assigned datacite doi by the ri itself or data publisher repository
and the orcid accounts of the individuals listed as owner producer contributor or fulfilling any other role as defined in
the datacite doi registry records in this way data publication credit can be automatically assigned organizations agencies institutes and ris
themselves involved in the data production chain registering and thus assigning persistent identifier to an organizational entity can be very
complicated to achieve in practice since some types of organizations and groupings tend to be quite short lived or may
be quite frequently reorganized to facilitate unambiguous identification of the organizational entities institutes universities agencies etc associated with the production
of data set it is recommended to register the organizations in isni orcid is also planning to offer support for
organizations sensors sensor platforms and measurement campaigns cruises to simplify the unambiguous referencing to the specific conditions of data collection
for example in scientific literature and in the metadata records of datasets it is recommended to set up and maintain
ri specific catalogue of all sensors that are used to collect data and subsequently assign pid to each sensor pointing
to landing page driven by the catalogue assign pids also to platforms used for sensor deployment buoys aircraft towers etc
create separate pid records for time limited measurement campaigns and cruises physical samples registering samples in catalogue and assigning unique
identifiers to them provides simple yet very effective way to refer to the samples in publications analysis workflows and related
provenance records geological samples and similar can be registered at igsn biological samples especially those from life science research may
be indexed in the xyz system for other sample categories pid pointing to the sample metadata record in catalogue can
easily be created queries used for accessing and retrieving subsets of datasets this follows the rda data citation working group
recent recommendations format the query in referable manner for example text file or an executable url assign pid to the
query object data content types this refers to data type registries data type definitions which should always be presentable in
forms that are interpretable both by human and machine users are intended to guide the proper usage of dataset select
or define an adequate schema for the data type definitions this can be dublin core inspire iso or something else
using data type registry enter the data type definition following the selected schema the definition is stored and assigned pid
the type definition pid can then be used in data object descriptive metadata outlining its content software releases used in
the data processing refer to github and similar software repositories which also support versioning no direct doi coupling yet workflows
used in the data processing refer to features built into workflow engines like kepler archive packages containing bundles of related
configuration files and scripts can be published using zenodo technologies services and tools ris need access to services that provide
registration indexing and discovery through lookup of the associated handles of objects preferably at the moment the objects are ingested
into trusted repository in the case that ri does not operate sophisticated enough cataloguing service capable of supporting landing pages
with the necessary level and detail of metadata and other information then this capability needs to be provided by an
external service provider as an example the metadata catalogue operated by datacite supports quite exhaustive set of attributes that may
be used to populate landing pages for data objects that have been assigned doi to extract usage statistics the ri
needs to combine information on the frequency of access of data resource with bibliometry information based on citations and mentions
in scientific literature and other media the access frequency analysis may include everything from positive search results visualization and downloads
via the ri own data center portal if applicable or the corresponding statistics from ri external repositories holding the data
partners here we should just list the most involved ri institutes and external organisations like rda orcid etc and refer

more generally orcid also facilitates the integration of ids in research workflows as well as linking of researchers with research
artefacts such as datasets following the recent integration of orcid in pangaea we have proposed to integrate orcid in envriplus
ris research infrastructures involve both technical and social entities the integration of orcid in ris will enable the identification of
social entities scientists technicians data managers etc and the linking of social with technical entities datasets software articles devices stations
such linking will enable unambiguous attribution of the contributions by social entities to the development implementation and maintenance of technical
entities ris can integrate orcid to various degrees first they can integrate orcid to identify their users the orcid id
can be managed user profile attribute akin to username password first and last name and email technically an ri can
decide to adopt the id as the primary key for user identification as an alternative to email or an internal
identifier second ris can integrate orcid to identify contributors to datasets curated by the infrastructure or contributors to development implementation
or maintenance of other ri elements third and beyond identification ris can integrate orcid to push information about the relationships
between pids of research artefacts and orcid ids of people who contribute to the development implementation or maintenance of the
artefacts ris have the possibility to automatically push such information to orcid in order to update contributor orcid records and
enable public attribution of contributions finally ris can adopt orcid as social login option as the sole or additional authentication
mechanism the proposal to discuss and coordinate orcid integrations in envriplus ris was presented at the 3rd envriweek in november
the presentation at envriweek followed short survey submitted to ris that aimed at quick assessment of the relevance timeliness and
state of orcid integrations in ris among the replies of the ris plan to integrate orcid one of which is
partially in implementation phase this preliminary survey highlights that orcid integrations are relevant and timely hence we plan to build
on the experiences gained in integrating orcid in pangaea and continue discussions and coordination to increase understanding of the requirements
and challenges faced by ris in integrating orcid this effort is aimed at facilitating such integrations in envriplus as related
activity pangaea has discussed the persistent identification of instruments as well as platforms and deployments at pidapalooza reykjavik iceland november
the session motivated why we may want to persistently identify these entities and preserve metadata about them we presented two
existing infrastructures that utilize doi to identify platforms seismic station networks and deployments cruises the persistent identification of these entities
extends the application of pid beyond articles datasets and people the presentation is available at https doi org m9 figshare

millions of files aggregated at various levels time series experiments to identify and track them registered pids of epic are
an appropriate means but complex technological and organizational efforts are required to be supported in an international data federation like
is enes and esgf they are included in the cmip6 file headers and registered as part of the file publication
in the data federation the organizational aspects are coordinated in the world climate research program wcrp infrastructure panel wip the
technological aspects are implemented in the context of the earth system grid federation esgf and include highly scalable pid registration
infrastructure based on message queues for citation of these data aggregated groups of these files sets of experiments are equipped
with dois registered by datacite org epic pids as member of the pid consortium epic persistent identifiers for eresearch dkrz

with the technical information library tib hannover and is offered to the scientific earth system community dois digital object identifier

to integrate handle system based pids into the header of every file and integrate the pid registration process into the
esgf file publication process to tackle the scalability problems of the handle system with respect to pid registration distributed message
queuing based solution is being deployed and integrated with the esgf infrastructure further use of pids in the workflow is
under development in the context of managing data errata information datacite dois for identification and citation most long term archived
lta data is equipped with doi and registered at datacite here two main challenges had to be solved first unlike
printed paper stored data often undergo subsequent improvements or corrections for which the identifier system has to account here the
data dissemination system has to account for versioning from the data upload to the identification and to the graphical user
interface gui second as the upload of the metadata md to datacite involves the completion of final quality checks the
need for data citation in an earlier stage of the workflow arose in some projects see below early citation for
details of both challenges see the data management paper cmip6 data citation and long term archival at the wip resources
https www earthsystemcog org projects wip resources by stockhause et al between first in project publication and minting of the
doi early citation in the project cmip6 for data that have doi high degree of stability is expected which is
not the case after early publication in the project corrections might follow however already in this early phase the need
for an early citation became evident too the initial default citation information is collected from the data producer via the
scientific contact person given in the file header it is checked and entered into the meta database mdb by the
data repository the information is accessible to guis and other repositories by an api in case citation information changes the
data producers have to update the mdb via dedicated gui check of the new information follows marine ris add text

pid systems workshop talk credit where credit is due pids citations and bibliometry for research data collections the envriplus survey
responses showed that majority of ris find that absolutely necessary to ensure that credit for producing and managing of scientific
data sets is properly assigned down to the level of individual principal investigators pis in charge of measurement and observation
stations this result is in line with many earlier studies which have shown that the perceived lack of proper attribution
of data is major reason for the hesitancy felt by many researchers to share their data openly while there is
reasonable confidence that identification and subsequent citation practices will result in adequate possibilities to trace and account for usage of
individual datasets for example by assigning dois to data objects many ris are apprehensive and concerned about how usage statistics
for data collections can be fairly and correctly translated into usage credit for data items that are members of such
collections they fear it will be difficult or even impossible to trace back the provenance of actually used collection items
to their individual provider through the currently used data citation practices and bibliometry tools one of the main causes for
this concern is the increasing pressure from policy makers and funding agencies towards research groups and organizations to show that
their data are not only being released under open access policies but that they are also re used thus maximizing
the benefit of public investments indeed funding agencies are pushing towards increasingly more open data policies including re distribution and
commercial use of data at the same time the same usage statistics mainly in the form of citation metrics remains
the basis of documenting of scientific merit that is paramount for scientists employment and stations funding within envriplus decision has
been taken to set up task force to investigate different methods for how data usage metrics and statistics can be
improved not only for individual datasets but especially for collections of data sets negotiation strategy the case for negotiations we
need something very robust and well motivated here discussion partners publishers data usage indexers library organizations wish list for services
what services do we want priorities timelines generic identifier minting services discuss services like epic datacite but also zenodo figshare
and others for organizations like ris who have decided to procure and register their own handle prefixes icos is an
example it is highly desirable to be able to assign their own pids to both data and documents however at
the time of writing december it is not possible to use datacite for non data objects as this goes against

for more information identification what granularity do your ri data products have content wise all parameters together or separated by
measurement category temporally yearly monthly daily or other spatially by measurement station region country or all together how are the
data products of your ri stored as separate static files in database system or combination how does your ri treat
the versioning of data are older datasets simply replaced by updates or are several versions kept accessible in parallel how
do you identify different version of the same dataset is it important to your data users that every digital data
object is tagged with unique persistent digital identifier pid the metadata for data files contains checksum information for the objects
metadata including any documentation about the data object contents is given its own persistent identifier metadata and data objects can
be linked persistently by means of pids is your ri currently using or planning to use standardized system based on

indicate the kind of identifier system that are you using handle based epic or doi uuids or your own ri
specific system if you are using handle based pids are these handles pointing to landing pages if so are these
pages maintained by your ri or an external organization like the data centre used for archiving are costs associated with
pid allocation and maintenance of landing pages etc specified in your ri operational cost budget citation how does your designated

user community traditionally refer to datasets they use in publications by providing information about producer year report number if available
title or short description in the running text under materials and methods by adding information about producer year report number
if available title or short description in the references section by dois if available in the references section by using
other information by providing the data as supplementary information either complete or via link is it important to your data
