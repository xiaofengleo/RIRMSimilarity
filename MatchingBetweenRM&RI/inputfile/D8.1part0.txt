research infrastructures projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create more coherent interdisciplinary and interoperable cluster of environmental
research infrastructures across europe it is driven by three overarching goals promoting cross fertilization between infrastructures implementing innovative concepts and
devices across ris and facilitating research and innovation in the field of environment for an increasing number of users outside
the ris envriplus aligns its activities to core strategic plan where sharing multi disciplinary expertise will be most effective the
project aims to improve earth observation monitoring systems and strategies including actions to improve harmonization and innovation and generate common
solutions to many shared information technology and data related challenges it also seeks to harmonize policies for access and provide
strategies for knowledge transfer amongst ris envriplus develops guidelines to enhance transdisciplinary use of data and data products supported by
applied use cases involving ris from different domains the project coordinates actions to improve communication and cooperation addressing environmental ris
at all levels from management to end users implementing ri staff exchange programs generating material for ri personnel and proposing
common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating the socio economic impacts envriplus is expected to
facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single ris and at the pan ri level it promotes
efficient and multi disciplinary research offering new opportunities to users new tools to ri managers and new communication strategies for
environmental ri communities the resulting solutions services and other project outcomes are made available to all environmental ri initiatives thus
contributing to the development of coherent european ri ecosystem table of contents contents abstract document amendment procedure terminology project summary

software developed from the open source movement curation has become more visible and necessary this deliverable reviews the state of
the art and recommends architectural principles to be taken into account along with the inputs on other topics in the
initial and subsequent architectural design phases of envriplus method this activity t8 within wp8 was undertaken by the primary author
with contributions from key staff from other partners the steps taken within the first months of envriplus are as follows
literature review on curation and review of activities in other recent and current projects extraction of curation requirements from use
cases and stated requirements particularly from the work associated with d5 wp8 and wider discussion on the commonalities of metadata
required and processes workflows between curation and other ict aspects particularly cataloguing and provenance but also identification and citation wp6
and processing wp7 wp5 wp8 discussions on representation of curation in the developing envri reference model wp9 wp8 discussions on
evaluation of curation particularly against the use cases initial design of metadata and processing architecture for curation initial design of
governance for curation state of the art and review introduction context and scope digital curation爄s the selection preservation maintenance collection
and archiving of燿igital燼ssets 燚igital curation爀stablishes maintains and adds value to repositories of燿igital燿ata for present and future use this is often
accomplished by archivists librarians scientists historians and scholars wikipedia it should be noted that cataloguing curation and provenance are commonly
grouped together since the metadata workflow processes and legal issues associated with each have more than intersection in requirements and
therefore rather than generating independent systems common approach is preferable moreover there are strong interdependencies with identification and citation with
aaai with processing with optimisation with modelling and with architecture the origins of curation stretch back to the earliest librarianship
including making copies to be distributed in monasteries and in the well known case of the magna carta in uk
with distribution to cathedrals this finds its modern equivalent in lockss1 and to the identification and cataloguing with metadata of
objects of interest in museums key aspect of curation is the interplay between governance and technology finding technological solutions to
satisfy the principles of governance is not always easy another key aspect is involving the researchers in the decision making
of what to keep and what to discard this provides motivation for the process of curation including the provision of
appropriate metadata sources of state of the art technology information used relevant major sources are the data curation centre dcc
open archival information system oais both discussed below and research data alliance rda which has several relevant groups notably preservation2
but also active data management plans3 and reproducibility4 knowledge of the bibliography and of curation activities in current and recent
projects provide further source material short term analysis of state of the art and trends the ideal curation state is
aimed to ensure the availability of digital assets through media migration to ensure physical readability redundant copies to ensure availability
appropriate security and privacy measures to ensure reliability and appropriate metadata to allow discovery contextualisation and use including information on
provenance and rights the current practice commonly falls far short of this with preservation commonly linked with backup or recovery
usually limited to the physical preservation of the digital asset and lacking the steps of curation selection ingestion preservation archiving
including metadata and maintenance furthermore in the current state while datasets may be curated it is rare for software or
operational environments to be curated including these is necessary to achieve reusability belhajjame collecting them automatically has been demonstrated by
santana perez where processes in virtual environment are monitored and their interactions with external resources recorded the collected information is
used to automatically create virtual image in which the job can be deployed and re run on the cloud however
while this is feasible in homogeneous environment it is leading edge research topic to achieve this in heterogeneous environment such
as envriplus curation lifecycle the desirable lifecycle is represented by dcc digital curation centre diagram5 figure figure the curation lifecycle
model from dcc the digital curation centre data management plan increasingly research funders are demanding dmp data management plan different
organisations have proposed different templates and tools for plans but that of dcc is used widely6 as is the us
equivalent7 dmp is defined wikipedia a燿ata management plan爋r dmp is formal document that outlines how you will handle your燿ata燽oth during
your research and after the project is completed oais reference model oais open archival information systems reference model iso provides
generic conceptual framework for building complete archival repository and identifies the responsibilities and interactions of producers consumers and managers of
both paper and digital records the standard defines the processes required for effective long term preservation and access to information
objects while establishing common language to describe these it does not specify an implementation but provides the framework to make
successful implementation possible through describing the basic functionality required for preservation archive it identifies mandatory responsibilities and provides standardised methods
to describe repository functionality by providing detailed models of archival information and archival functions higgins set of metadata elements in
structure has been proposed8 rda research data alliance the research data alliance has groups working on this see above however
their work is brought together with that of other groups in the specification of metadata9 rda has proposed some metadata
principles the only difference between metadata and data is mode of use metadata is not just for data it is
also for users software services computing resources metadata is not just for description and discovery it is also for contextualisation
relevance quality restrictions rights costs and for coupling users software and computing resources to data to provide vre metadata must
be machine understandable as well as human understandable for autonomicity formalism management meta data is also relevant research proposal funding
project information research outputs outcomes impact and furthermore metadata element set that covers all the uses of metadata not just
curation unique identifier for later use including citation location url description keywords terms temporal coordinates spatial coordinates originator organisation person
project facility equipment quality availability licence persistence provenance citations related publications white or grey related software schema medium format it
should be noted that many elements within this set have internal structure syntax and semantics meaning and so are not
simple attributes with values the rda groups are currently working on unpacking the elements to form suitable for discovery contextualisation
and action by both humans and computers problems to be overcome the following are some important problems that need to
be addressed for curation motivation there is little motivation for researchers to curate their digital assets at present curation activity
obtains no reward such as career preferment based on data citations in some organisations curation of digital assets is regarded
as librarian function but without the detailed knowledge of the researcher the associated metadata is likely to be substandard increasingly
funding agencies are demanding curation of digital assets produced by publicly funded research business model curation involves deciding what assets
to curate and of those for how long they should be kept determining an appropriate duration of retention for digital
asset is problem economics and business models do not manage well the concept of infinite time first business justification is
needed in that the asset cannot be collected again it is unique observation experiment the cost of collecting again by
the same or another researcher is greater than the cost of curation metadata metadata collection is expensive unless it is
automated or at least partially automated during the data lifecycle by re using information already collected commonly metadata is generated
separately for discovery contextualisation curation and provenance when much of the metadata content is shared across these functions comprehensive but
incrementally completed metadata element set is required that covers the required functions of the lifecycle it needs sufficient application domain
data that other specialists in that domain will be able to find and correctly interpret the associated data process the
lifecycle of digital research entities is well understood and it needs process support the incremental metadata collection aspect is critically
important for success workflow models if adapted to such an incremental metadata collection with appropriate validation are likely to be
valuable here jeffery curation of data it may be considered that curation of data is straightforward but it is not
first the dataset may not be static by analogy with type specimen in museum both streamed data and updateable databases
are dynamic thus leaving management decisions to be made on frequency of curation and management of versions with obvious links
to provenance issues related to security and privacy change with time and the various licences for data use each have
different complexities the data may change ownership or stewardship copies may be made and distributed to ensure availability but then
have to be managed in systems such as lockss derivatives may be generated and require management including relationships with the
original dataset and all its attendant metadata curation of software software written years ago is unlikely to compile let alone
compose with software libraries and execute today indeed many items of software such as the workflows behind scientific method will
either not run or give different results six months later since many research propositions are based on the combination of
the software algorithm and dataset then the preservation and curation of the software becomes very important it is likely that
in future it will be necessary to curate not only the software but also specification of the software in canonical
representation so that the same software process or algorithm can be reconstructed and ideally generated from the specification this leaves
the question of whether associated software libraries are considered part of the software to be curated or part of the
operating environment see below very often software contains many years worth of intellectual investment by collaborating experts it is not
unusual for the software to encode the scientific method used by the researcher which may be less well or less
formally documented elsewhere scholarly publications this makes software very valuable and hard to replace taking good care of such assets
will be requirement for most research communities curation of operational environments it is necessary to record the operational environment of
the software and dataset the hardware used whether instrumentation for collection or computation devices has characteristics relating to accuracy precision
operational speed capacity and many more the operating system has defined characteristics and includes device drivers software library used by
the application it is moot point whether software libraries belong to the application software or to the operational environment for
the purposes of curation finally the management ethos of the operational environment normally represented as policies requires curation longer term
horizon there is some cause for optimism media costs are decreasing so more can be preserved for less and the
cost reduction hopefully matches the expansion of volume awareness of the need for curation is increasing partly through policies of
funding organisations and partly through increased responsibility of some researchers research projects in ict are starting to produce autonomic systems
that could be used to assist with curation however the major problem is the cost of collecting metadata for curation
firstly incremental collection along the workflow with re use of existing information should assist workflow systems should be evolved to
accomplish this secondly improving techniques of automated metadata extraction from digital objects may reach production status in this timeframe10 issues
and implications commonality of metadata elements across curation provenance cataloguing and more implies that common core metadata scheme should be
used for interoperability possibly with extensions for particular domains where interoperability is not required metadata collection is expensive so incremental
collection along the workflow is required workflow systems should be evolved to accomplish this and scientific methods and data management
working practices should be formalised using such workflows to reduce chores and risks of error as well as to gather
the metadata required for curation automated metadata extraction from digital objects shows promise but production system readiness is some years
away however metadata provision from equipment generated streamed data is available envriplus should adopt the dcc recommendations envriplus should track
the relevant rda groups and ideally participate use cases and requirements all the requirements obtained from the interviews and the
use cases indicated some awareness of the need for digital curation however few ris had advanced towards providing systems to
achieve curation and even those that had advanced had not full data management plan including business case in place the
curation requirements validate the need for envriplus developing curation solutions but do not converge on particular requirements this brief analysis
is based on the information supplied by seven ris who responded to this topic see the wiki page for details11
in the planned work of envriplus this work is already conceptually and practically interrelated with cataloguing and provenance in wp8
as remarked above it should also strongly couple with the work on data identification and citation consequently many of the
issues that emerge are similar to those identified above however some further issues arise these are enumerated below the appreciation
of the needs for curation is varied and often limited one manifestation of this is the almost universal absence of
complete data management plans12 in practice dmp evolves providing early the essentials for data collection and availability to the immediate
community and later interoperability across the whole domain with enhanced metadata including not only descriptions of the data but also
information on rights security and privacy consequently this topic again poses requirement for an envriplus programme of awareness raising and
training if that is conducted collaboratively then it will also help develop cross disciplinary alliances that will benefit scientific outcomes
management decisions and long term cost benefit trade offs the need for intellectual as well as ict interworking between these
closely related topics identification and citation curation cataloguing and provenance is already recognised their integration will need to be well
supported by tools services and processing workflows used to accomplish the scientific methods and the curation procedures however there was
negligible awareness of the need to preserve software and the contextual information necessary to re run it with identical effects
the need for this combination for reproducibility is identified by belhajjame et al with implementations automatically capturing the context and
synthesising virtual environments belhajjame as above it is vital to support the day to day working practices and the innovation
steps that occur in the context of curation with appropriate automation and tools this is critical both to make good
use of the time and effort of those performing curation and to support innovators introducing new scientific methods with consequential
curation needs the challenge of handling all forms of data described in problems to be overcome for identification and citation
is compounded with the need to properly capture diverse forms of software or better formal specifications of the software and
wide variety of often distributed computational contexts in order to fully support reproducibility curation needs to address preservation and sustainability
carefully preserving key information to underwrite the quality and reproducibility of science requires that the information remains accessible for sufficient
time this is not just the technical challenge of ensuring that the bits remain stored interpretable and accessible it is
also the socio political challenge of ensuring longevity of the information as communities and funders priorities vary this is significant
step beyond archiving which is addressed in eudat with the b2safe service13 one aspect of the approach to sustainable archiving
is to form federations with others undertaking data curation as suggested by oais14 federation arrangements are also usually necessary in
order that the many curated sources of data environmental scientists need to use are made conveniently accessible such data intensive
federations dif underpin many forms of multi disciplinary collaboration and supporting them well is key step in achieving success as
each independently run data source may have its own priorities and usage policies often imposed and modified by its funders
it is essential to set up and sustain an appropriate dif for each community of users many of the ris
deliver such federations today without common framework to help them and many of the envriplus partners are members of multiple
federations architectural design principles for curation introduction we start with the state of the art and the requirements these indicate
technologies are available for curation but they may not be compatible with those for cataloguing and provenance governance principles for
curation are lacking widely among the envri community most ris in the envri community appreciate the importance of curation but
are not practising it partly because existing used metadata standards do not support it explicitly and or can only be
made to support it partially on the other hand there are examples of successful curation activity in other communities such
as those that support life sciences reference data pdb berman and those that support sky surveys szalay major problem in
envriplus is the heterogeneity of the ris in both governance and technology this may hinder take up of any recommended
curation solution on the other hand some of the ris already form informal clusters usually by environmental domain so there
may be scope for collaborative work on curation with consequent increased benefit for the cost governance principles for curation introduction
since there is relative to the volumes of data little curation activity in envriplus ris at present as recorded in
d5 we can make recommendations expecting that there will be few problems integrating with existing governance and practices the key
recommendation is that ris should have dmp and ideally use the dcc documentation this ensures the ris are actually thinking
about the issue they generate governance recommendations relevant to their community and the assets of data software and processing environments
they adopt an appropriate metadata standard for cataloguing curation and provenance or in the event of multiple established heterogeneous metadata
formats they choose canonical format and provide convertors where appropriate ris within an environmental domain cluster so as to share
the cost and benefit from experience of curation initial design introduction the initial design is based not just on the
state of the art and requirements for curation but also for cataloguing and provenance and also identification citation and processing
for the reasons outlined above the design consists of two components the catalog metadata and the curation processes catalog metadata
the catalog for the purposes of curation needs to describe the asset to be curated with rich metadata the metadata
must provide sufficient information for asset discovery contextualization for relevance and quality and action this is analogous to but goes
beyond in the area of action the fair principles15 in the case of curation the action is to ensure an
asset can be made available when required is understandable to human and computer systems the use of logic representation provides
advantages in deduction facts from rules and induction rules from facts which reduces potentially the metadata input burden and increases
the validity of the metadata furthermore because of versioning and the relationship to provenance the metadata must include temporal information
this system design aspect therefore depends on t8 and its deliverable d8 however the required metadata elements can be specified
derived from d5 and the work of the metadata interest group and its sub groups of rda16 see above under
state of the art the base entities objects typically required but note these may be complex with internal structure syntax
and semantics are research product asset person organisation project research publication citation facility equipment service geographic bounding box country postal
address electronic address language currency indicator measurement funding and these entities need to be linked by linking entities to provide
the role relationship semantics between base entities and the temporal duration of the truth of the assertion the role linking
the base entities the linking entities can refer to instances within the same base entity research product related to research
product with role derived or research product related to organisation with role rightsholder this structure gives great flexibility the role
relationships between research product and person could be creator reviewer user those between research product and facility equipment and service
record the digital collection of the asset research product indicators and measurement relate to quality when linked to research product
the address information may be linked to organization such as the one owning the facility the facility itself the person
or the organization employing the person for the purpose of research the metadata structure outlined above could be encoded in
rdf as in the ckan metadata of eudat b2find b2save and using rdf could be made compatible with the w3c
prov standard for provenance so linking curation and provenance alternatively the above conceptual structure could be encoded in cerif common
european research information format eu recommendation to member states which is used widely for research information management but also for
the epos project where it forms the catalog cerif has been mapped to dc dublin core dcat data catalog vocabulary
ckan comprehensive knowledge archive network which has is own metadata format based on dc and iso19115 inspire eu directive the
initial mapping to from prov o18 has been done in joint work between eurocris and csiro canberra cerif provides switchboard
for interoperability as superset model compared with the others capable of representing fully connected graph and having declared semantics with
crosswalk capability however the existing metadata standards used within the ris do not reach this level of richness of representation
convertors can be provided but it is certain that ris will need to provide additional information supplementing that in their
existing metadata to achieve appropriate curation and for that matter provenance and cataloguing especially for interoperation purposes d8 from t8
proposes that envriplus recommends ckan and cerif as the canonical metadata standard and implements them within any prototype curation processes
the processes associated with curation are store an asset dataset with metadata sufficient for curation purposes discover an asset using
the metadata the richer the metadata and the more elaborate the query the greater the precision in discovering the required
asset copy an asset with its updated metadata to have distributed backup version copy an asset with its updated metadata
media migration to ensure availability move an asset with its updated metadata to distributed location if the original location is
unable to manage curation partition an asset and copy move across distributed locations with its updated metadata for privacy and
security partition an asset and copy move across distributed locations with its updated metadata for performance including locality of data
with software and processing power all these processes could be applied to set of assets as well as single asset
these processes are all simple given rich metadata in the catalog as outlined above conclusions the initial design of the
curation functionality aims to maximize flexibility while retaining compatibility with the other tasks in wp8 namely provenance and the catalog
the catalog is central to the design and the choice of the metadata elements in the catalog including their syntax
and semantics is crucial for the processes not only of curation but also of provenance and catalog management and utilisation
the metadata model of the catalog has also to permit interoperation among ris as well as the usual processes associated
with metadata catalogs discovery contextualisation and action this implies that the model must be superset in representation of syntax and
semantics of the metadata models used or planned within the ris d8 from t8 proposes the use of ckan as
used in eudat and cerif for the metadata catalog however before proceeding to detailed design and prototype implementation it is
necessary to validate both ckan and cerif against the requirements of provenance which task does not start until later in
the project and the catalog impact on the project this deliverable relates closely to other tasks and deliverables first within
wp8 cataloguing and curation but also wp6 identification and citation and wp7 processing leading towards representation in the reference model
and the overall architecture design wp5 and evaluation wp9 the choice of metadata standard for the catalog is critical decision
for the project it is expected that this deliverable will cause ris to increase their attention to and effort on
curation the result of positive action will be archives of curated environmental data essential for later research especially comparing the
state of the environmental domain at that future time with now and past states as recorded impact on stakeholders the
correct choice of catalog metadata standard has huge influence on stakeholders since it conditions what processing facilities are available to
all ris in envriplus the metadata has to support not only curation and provenance but also the usual research processes
of discovery contextualization which may involve visualisation and action which utilize the catalog to access and utilize the digital assets
of the ris and more importantly perhaps to interoperate across the ris to allow novel interdisciplinary research this deliverable should
cause ris to re assess their strategy for curation and increase attention and effort on it not only for the
benefit of their community now and in the future but also for other communities interoperating with their own to achieve
