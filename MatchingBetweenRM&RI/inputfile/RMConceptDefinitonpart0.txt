reference model classifier categorisation used to classify things present in particular view of system modelling viewpoint viewpoint on distributed system
as defined by rm odp reference model thing thing that exists in the context of one or more views of
system computational view thing the computational view point of the model accounts for the major computational objects expected within environment
research infrastructure and the interfaces by which they can be interacted with each object encapsulates functionality that needs to be
collectively implemented by service or resource within the infrastructure each object also provides number of interfaces by which that functionality
can be invoked or by which the object can invoke the functions of other objects by binding compatible interfaces together
network of interactions between objects can be described that demonstrates the computational requirements of compliant research infrastructure engineering view thing
concepts defined for the engineering viewpoint in the recommendation information technology open distributed processing reference model foundations architecture information view
thing the goal of the information viewpoint is to provide common abstract model for the shared information handled by the
infrastructure the focus lies on the information itself without considering any platform specific or implementation details it is independent from
the computational interfaces and functions that manipulate the information or the nature of technology used to store it similar to
high level ontology it aims to provide unique and consistent interpretation of the shared information entities of particular domain the
information viewpoint specifies the types of the information objects and the relationships between those types it describes how the state
of the data evolves as the results of computational operations it also defines the constraints on the data and the
rules governing the processing of such data reference activity activity involving objects present in view of system operation computation operation
represents remote functionality invoked by one computation object onto one or more other objects complex operation complex operation represents remote
functionality invoked by one computation object onto binding object created to broker interaction between more than two computational objects brokered
data export exporting data out of research infrastructure entails retrieving data from the data curation subsystem and delivering it to
an external resource this process must be brokered by the data use and data publishing subsystems brokered data import importing
data from sources other than the acquisition network requires that the import be brokered by the publishing subsystem before data
can be delivered into the data curation subsystem data staging the staging of data for processing within research infrastructure entails
retrieving data from the data curation subsystem and delivering it to the data processing subsystem raw data collection the collection
of raw scientific data requires coordination between the data acquisition phase which extracts the raw data from instruments and the
data curation phase which packages and stores the data simple operation simple operation represents remote functionality invoked by one computation
object onto another acquire identifier is used to request new persistent identifier to be associated with the data being transferred
annotate data is used to request annotation of data held within the data curation subsystem of research infrastructure authorise action
is used to retrieve authorisation for any restricted interactions with the data acquisition subsystem calibrate instrument is used to calibrate
the reading of data by instruments based in principle on scientific analysis of data output this interface can also be
used to monitor activity on given instrument configure controller is used to configure data collection and other configurable factors on
individual instruments coordinate process is used to coordinate the execution of data processing tasks on execution resources presented by process
controllers export metadata is used to retrieve any additional metadata to be associated with the data being transferred prepare data
transfer is used to negotiate data transfers into the data curation subsystem process request is used to make requests of
the research infrastructure pertaining to data processing query data is used to forward queries onto the data curation subsystem of
research infrastructure and receive the results query resource is used to retrieve data from data stores request data is used
to make requests of the research infrastructure pertaining to curated datasets resolve identifier is used to resolve identifiers retrieve data
is used to request new persistent identifier to be associated with the data being transferred translate request is used to
invoke semantic broker where some mapping between different semantic domains is deemed necessary update catalogue is used to update or
initiate the update of data catalogues or catalogue information managed by catalogue service update model is used to update semantic
models associated with research infrastructure update record is used to directly annotate existing datasets curated within one or more data
stores update registry is used to register and unregister instruments with the data acquistion subsystem data stream operation type of
computational operation that involves the streaming of data from one computational object to another deliver dataset is used to retrieve
external datasets stored in external data stores outside of the data curation subsystem deliver raw data is used to collect
raw data sent by instruments in the data acquisition subsystem export curated data is used to retrieve curated datasets stored
within data stores in the data curation subsystem import data for curation receives data packaged for curation within the associated
datastore stage data is used to acquire data sent from the data curation subsystem of research infrastructure needed as part
of some process information action information actions model the information processing in the system every action is associated with at
least one object actions cause state changes in the objects that participate in them add metadata add additional data according
to predefined schema metadata schema this partially overlaps with data annotations annotate entity the general class of annotation actions assign
unique identifier obtain unique identifier and associate it to the data build conceptual model establish local or global model of
interrelated concepts this may involve the following issues commitment the agreement of larger group of scientists data providers data users
as to what should be achieved unambiguousness the conceptual model should be unambiguously defined readability the model should be readable
by both human and machine ontologies for instance express the meaning of the concepts with the relations to other concepts
while being human and machine readable and it has recently become increasingly important to add definitions in human readable language
and availability the conceptual model must be referenceable and dereferenceable for long time carry out backup replicate data to an
additional data storage so it may be used to restore the original after data loss event longterm preservation is special
type of backup check quality actions to verify the quality of data for example it may involve removing noise removing
apparently wrong data calculating calibrations quality checks can be carried out at different points in the chain of data lifecycle
quality checks can be supported by software tools for those processes which can be automated statistic tolerance checks cite data
produce reference to persistent data or metadata convert data converting and generating data products for instance translating to different format
describe service describe the accessibility of service or processes which is available for reuse the interfaces the description of behavior
and or implemented algorithms final review review the data to be published which will not likely be changed again the
action triggers the change of the data state to be finally reviewed in practice an annotation for such state change
should be recorded for provenance purposes usually this is coupled with archiving and versioning actions perform mapping execute transformation rules
for values mapping from one unit to another unit or translation rules for concepts translating the meaning from one conceptual
model to another conceptual model translating code lists perform measurement or observation measure parameter or observe an event the performance
of measurement or observation produces measurement results process data process data for the purposes of converting and generating data products
calculations statistical processes simulation models visualisation alpha numerically graphically geographically data processes should be recorded as provenance instances produce model
creation of statistical models simulation models or summaries with the data provided publish data make data public accessible for example
this can be done by presenting them in browsable form on the world wide web or by presenting them via
special services such as restful service soap service an open grid service an ogc service web feature service web map
service etc or sparql endpoint publish metadata make the registered metadata available to the public query entity query some entity
such as dataset metadata or annotation query data send request to data store to retrieve required data in practice there
are two types of data query first the two step approach wherein step is to query search metadata and step
is to access data for example when using ogc services it usually first invokes web feature service to obtain feature
descriptions then web map service is invoked to obtain map images second the one step approach wherein data is queried
directly by using sql services or sparql endpoints requests can be directly sent to service or distributed by broker query
metadata send request to metadata resources to retrieve metadata of interests query provenance this action requests specific persisted data about
the provenance of some data or metadata this is usually done to determine the origin and validity of data but
can also be helpful for citation and referencing resolve annotation retrieve the reference to the specific set of objects that
correspond to set of annotation terms register metadata enter the metadata into metadata catalogue setup mapping rules specify the mapping
rules of data and or concepts these rules should be explicitly expressed using language that can be processed by software
minimal set of mapping rules should include the following data source data concept for which the mapping is valid target
data concept for which the mapping is valid the mapping process the translation and or transformation process validity constraints for
the mapping temporal constraints context constraints etc specify investigation design specify design of investigation including sampling design this may include
geographical position of measurement or observation site the selections of observations and measurement sites can be statistical or stratified by
domain knowledge characteristics of site preconditions of measurements specify measurement or observation specify the details of the method of observations
measurements for example it may include the specification of measurement device type and its settings measurement observation intervals store data
archive or preserve data in persistent manner to ensure continued accessibility and usability track provenance automatically generate and store metadata
about the actions and the data state changes as provenance instances visualise data creating visual models which display data alpha
