is formal deliverable for the european commission applicable to all members of the envri project beneficiaries and joint research unit
members as well as its collaborating projects frontier environmental research increasingly depends on wide range of data and advanced capabilities
to process and analyse them the envri project òcommon operations of environmental research infrastructuresó is collaboration in the esfri environment
cluster with support from ict experts to develop common science components and services for their facilities the results will speed
up the construction of these infrastructures and will allow scientists to use the data and software from each facility to
enable multi disciplinary science the target is on developing common capabilities including software and services of the environmental infrastructure communities
while the envri infrastructures are very diverse they face common challenges including data capture from distributed sensors metadata standardisation management
of high volume data workflow execution and data visualisation the common standards deployable services and tools developed will be adopted
by each infrastructure as it progresses through its construction phase the project will be based on common reference model created
by capturing the semantic resources of each esfri env infrastructure this model and the development driven by the test bed
deployments result in ready to use systems which can be integrated into the environmental research infrastructures the project puts emphasis
on synergy between advanced developments not only among the infrastructure facilities but also with ict providers and related science initiatives
these links will facilitate system deployment and the training of future researchers and ensure that the inter disciplinary capabilities established
here remain sustainable beyond the lifetime of the project the envri reference model provides the esfri environmental research infrastructures with
common ontological framework and standards for the description and characterisation of computational and storage infrastructures in order to achieve seamless
interoperability between the heterogeneous resources of different infrastructures this guideline is prepared to help reference model users to understand key
model concepts and map the abstraction to concretions it uses set of practical examples to illustrate various ways of the
envri reference model the intention is to provide users with way of thinking which may lead to exploration of the
model itself and inspire the discovery of various way of using the model using number of examples we will show
that the reference model can benefit esfri environmental research with set of ready to use terminology with publicly accessible reference
base which can be used to describe requirements and architectural features of an infrastructure and serve as common language in
communication materials in particular with an external community without any specific knowledge of the scientific domain being addressed uniform framework
with well defined subsystems of components specified from different complementary viewpoints science information and computation which promotes structural thinking in
constructions of system architectures and can be used as research tool for comparison and analysis of heterogeneous infrastructures knowledge base
capturing existing requirements and state of the art design experiences the information provided can be referred to in various system
analysis tasks to guide design and implementation activities and to drive the development of common services the development of the
envri reference model hosted at www envri eu rm provides the esfri environmental research infrastructures esfri env ris with common
ontological framework for description and characterisation of computational and storage infrastructures and provides them community standard to help achieve greater
levels of interoperability between their heterogeneous resources the reference model defines conceptual model that captures computational requirements and state of
the art design experiences in sense the model reveals snapshot of the existing landscape of the esfri environmental science research
infrastructures at high level of abstraction in order to help reference model users map the abstraction to concretions so as
to better apply the knowledge in their daily practices we prepare this guideline that introduces our own experiments with the
reference model and in doing so reveal the principles of usage these principles are neither bound nor enforced they are
not mandatory for users to follow the intention is to provide users with way of thinking which may lead to
exploration of the model itself and inspire the discovery of various way of using the model rather than going through
each model term and explaining the meaning of it we use set of practical examples each of them illustrating some
aspects of the usage of the reference model as well as introducing number of model concepts initially examples are selected
with the aim to serve the primary audience1 within the community of esfri env ris we use scenarios that are
familiar to our users and include information that may be of interest to the community and perhaps benefit their work
see the intended audience of the reference model at http tinyurl com ksjmjzq to collect these examples we used template
with questions what is this use case about describe the purpose of the use case and any background information how
can the reference model be used in this use case what are the results of using the reference model evidence
of usefulness utility what are the benefits of using the reference model demonstrate specific cases of things that could not
have been achieved without the reference model are there any problems with using the reference model in this use case
feedback from users these questions proved to be helpful in organising investigation activities we encourage readers also to use this
template to structure newly developed stories and share them with us so as to inspire others with limited resources only
few examples are included these will be extended when more resources are available for future investigations the rest of the
document is arranged as follows we firstly revisit the key concepts of the reference model in section then introduce set
of examples in section and we summarise our work in section the envri reference model envri rm is built using
the open distributed processing odp framework an international standard for distributed system specification published by iso iec iso iec odp
provides an overall conceptual framework for specifying large or complex computing systems it adopts the object modelling approach and defines
five specific viewpoints abstractions that yield specifications of the whole system related to particular sets of concerns the five viewpoints
are the enterprise viewpoint which concerns the organisational situation in which business research activity in the current case is to
take place for better communication with the environmental science community we refer to this in the envri rm as the
science viewpoint the information viewpoint which concerns modelling of the shared information manipulated within the system of interest the computational
viewpoint which concerns the design of the analytical modelling and simulation processes and applications provided by the system the engineering
viewpoint which tackles the problems of diversity in infrastructure provision it gives the prescriptions for supporting the necessary abstract computational
interactions in range of different concrete situations the technology viewpoint which concerns real world constraints such as restrictions on the
facilities and technologies available to implement the system applied to the existing computing platforms on which the computational processes must
execute the reasons for adopting odp in envri include it provides descriptive framework for specifying and building large or complex
system that consist of set of guiding concepts and terminology this provides way of thinking about architectural issues in terms
of fundamental patterns or organising principles it enables large collaborative design activities odp breaks down complex design specification into separated
but interlined viewpoints which allows designers in different teams from different organisations to work in parallel and to deliver uniform
specifications there is natural fit between the odp viewpoints and interoperability requirements in science zhao being an international standard odp
offers authority and stability in the next subsection we revisit key contents of the model which are described using the
odp terms and concepts the development of the reference model is based on preliminary study of collection of the representative
environmental research infrastructures chen by examining their computational characteristics common subsystems2 have been identified data acquisition data curation data access
data processing and community support the fundamental reason of the division of the subsystems is based on the observation that
all applications services and software tools are designed and implemented around major physical resources the sensor network the storage the
internet communication network application servers and client devices the definitions of the five subsystems are given below here we define
subsystem as set of capabilities that collectively are defined by set of interfaces with corresponding operations that can be invoked
by other subsystems an interface in odp is an abstraction of the behaviour of an object that consists of subset
of the interactions of that object together with set of constraints on when they may occur linington data acquisition collects
raw data from sensor arrays various instruments or human observers and brings the measurements data streams into the system data
curation facilitates quality control and preservation of scientific data it is typically operated at data centre data access enables discovery
and retrieval of data housed in data resources managed by data curation subsystem data processing aggregates the data from various
resources and provides computational capabilities and capacities for conducting data analysis and scientific experiments community support manages controls and tracks
users activities and supports users to conduct their roles in communities amongst the five subsystems can be identified seven major
points of reference wherein interfaces between subsystems can be implemented these points of reference are as follows acquisition curation by
which the collection of raw data is managed curation access by which the retrieval of curated data products is arranged
acquisition access by which the collection of raw data and the status of the observation network can be accessed and
monitored externally curation processing by which analyses of curated data is coordinated acquisition processing by which acquisition events are listened
for and responded to processing access by which data processes are scheduled and reported community all by which the outside
world interacts with the infrastructure in many different roles depending on the distribution of resources in an implemented infrastructure some
of these reference points may not be present in the infrastructure they take particular importance however when considering scenarios where
research infrastructure delegates subsystems to other client infrastructures for example epos3 and lifewatch4 both delegate data acquisition and some data
curation activities to client national or domain specific infrastructures but provide data processing services over the data held by those
client infrastructures thus reference points and become of significant importance to the construction of those projects analysis of the common
requirements of the six esfri env ris has resulted in the identification of number of common functionalities as shown in
figure these functionalities can be partitioned amongst the five subsystems they encompass range of concerns from the fundamental data collection
and storage data discovery and access and data security to more specific challenges data versioning instrument monitoring and interactive visualisation
in order to better manage the range of requirements and in order to ensure rapid publication of incremental refinements to
the envri rm minimal model has been identified which describes the fundamental functionality necessary to describe functional environmental research infrastructure
the minimal model focuses on the major interaction links from raw data acquisition to the access and export of specific
curated datasets passing through stages of curation brokering and authorisation this core interaction chain represents the most fundamental contract between
the archetypical research infrastructure and its community the access to scientific observations measurements the core interactions between data curation and
data processing as well as uploading of contributions from outside the infrastructure are also present in the minimal model providing
the skeleton by which additional extensions to the reference model can be attached including alternative mechanisms for data retrieval and
presentation by initially focusing on this minimal model it then becomes practical to produce partial specification of the envri rm
which nonetheless reflects the final shape of the envri rm without the need for significant refactoring further development of the
envri rm will focus on designated priority areas based on feedback from the contributing esfri representatives the definitions of the
functionalities are given at the reference model wiki site http miniurl com 92mz the envri rm subsystems are specified using
the odp standard framework the envri rm defines an ôarchetypicalõ environmental research infrastructure rather than specific implemented infrastructure three viewpoints
take particular priority the science information and computational viewpoints which gives better focus on the core objective of envri to
develop an understanding of the common requirements and to provide the design solutions for common data and operation services the
science viewpoint of the envri rm intends to capture the requirements for an environmental research infrastructure from the perspective of
the people who perform their tasks and achieve their goals as mediated by the infrastructure the key concepts defined in
this viewpoint include communities and their roles and behaviours common communities are specified in according to the subsystems data acquisition
data curation data publication data service provision and data usage the definition of the communities are based on community objectives
data acquisition community who collect raw data and bring streams of measurements into an infrastructure data curation community who curate
the scientific data maintain and archive them and produce various data products with metadata data publication community who assist data
publication discovery and access data service provision community who provide various services applications and software tools to link and recombine
data and information in order to derive knowledge data usage community who make use of data and service products and
transfer knowledge into understanding by analysing common requirements use scenarios for each community are derived community roles and behaviours are
identified6 the definitions of these concepts can be found at www envri eu rm information viewpoint the information viewpoint provides
common abstract model for the shared information handled by the infrastructure the focus lies on the information itself without considering
any platform specific or implementation details it is independent from the computational interfaces and functions that manipulate the information or
the nature of technology used to store it it specifies the types of the information objects and the relationships between
those types and how the states of these objects change as results of computational operations modelling in this viewpoint in
the envri context employs data oriented approach which follows the lifecycle of scientific data from raw to published and processed
data as information objects in each subsystem identifying their behaviour changes when events or action occur the model captures common
issues challenging many environmental research infrastructures such as data enrichment including attribution of unique identifiers necessary for unambiguous identification and
tracking of data provenance association of metadata semantic annotation quality assessment semantic mapping and data discovery the model has been
continuously refined by examining the feasibility of implementations and applying community feedback the resulting model consists of set of information
objects managed and processed by the common subsystems set of action types which are events that cause the states changes
of the information objects and set of constraints on these objects the model also specifies the static schemata and the
dynamic schemata the static schemata defines instantaneous views of the information objects at certain stage of the data lifecycle defining
minimum set of constraints for data sharing on the other hand the dynamic schemata captures how the information object evolve
as the system operates specifying the allowable state changes as the effects of the actions for example figure shows simple
dynamic schemata which specifies allowable states represented by boxes of an information object after applying certain actions types represented by
arrows between states the computational viewpoint of the envri rm accounts for the major computational objects expected within an environmental
research infrastructure and the interfaces by which they interact each object encapsulates functionality implemented by service or resource within the
infrastructure this encapsulation occurs at the conceptual level rather than the implementation level it is admissible for the functions of
given object to be distributed across multiple computational resources in an implemented infrastructure should that suit the infrastructureõs physical architecture
each object provides number of interfaces by which functions can be invoked on the object or by which the object
can invoke the functions of other objects by linking client and server interfaces network of interactions between objects can be
built that demonstrates the computational dependencies of different parts of an infrastructure these bindings can then be further specified in
order to determine the particular operations and information streams supported by the interaction between interfaces as well as the information
objects that must be present figure an example of interactions between interfaces of computational objects operations are represented by ball
and socket connections the client provides the socket while the server provides the ball data streams are represented by thick
dashed lines in the direction of the data flow for example simplified brokered upload interaction might take the form illustrated
in figure four computational objects are identified the science gateway encapsulating user afforded functionality the data import service handling import
requests into the infrastructure an internal data store controller managing access to particular data store in the infrastructure and an
external data source controller from which data is to be extracted in this instance the data import service manages access
via its import data and coordinate data import operational interfaces responding to request from the science gateway and invoking selected
data store respectively this exchange of requests between objects can be further specified using for example suitable uml sequence diagram
once the data transfer has been validated and configured the data can be pulled from the data source to the
data store via compatible stream interfaces each of the five essential subsystems of the envri rm must provide number of
computational objects of the kind illustrated above to be distributed across an infrastructure technical architecture for each of those objects
suitable interfaces must be identified and the most important interactions between those interfaces described in the envri rm the interfaces
between subsystems are given particular attention as many critical functions intercede in the movement of data between subsystems figure subset
of the core interactions involved in the acquisition and access of data using the notation of figure as observed in
the majority of studied cases the chains of bindings between objects indicate the intermediaries involved in interactions between objects in
different subsystems figure illustrates the computational objects involved in basic data acquisition curation and access positioned with respect to four
of the five research infrastructure subsystems client server interface labels have been merged for clarity multi party interactions are coordinated
via binding objects7 such as raw data collection and brokered data export that serve to simplify such interactions by abstracting
aside implementation specific details of the coordination such as how information and control is passed between objects when three or
more parties are involved binding object is an odp computational object which supports binding between set of other computational objects
linington thus the archetypical research infrastructure is considered here as having brokered service oriented architecture core functionality is encapsulated in
number of service objects that control various resources present in the infrastructure access to most of these services by external
entities is overseen by various brokers that validate requests and provide an interoperability layer between heterogeneous components this is particularly
important for federated infrastructures which may not be able to enforce core set of standards on all data and services
being integrated the section review the envri reference model which exists to illustrate common characteristics of environmental sciences research infrastructures
and establishes taxonomy of terms concepts and definitions in order to provide common language and understanding promote technology and solution
sharing and improve interoperability the envri reference model is work in progress currently attention is focused on three of the
five odp viewpoints science enterprise information and computational the remaining viewpoints of engineering and technology have been deferred to later
date in the next section we use set of practical examples to illustrate the usage of the reference model collection
of examples demonstrating usage of the envri reference model is given below different examples may serve different purposes some of
them merely illustrate different way of using the reference model example while others also intend to introduce model concepts where
many terms are highlighted with clickable links please click those highlighted concepts that will re locate you to the related
definitions and specifications in the reference model be sure to go through all terms marked with some of them though
repeated will guide you to different part of the model by visiting all linked contents you will have explored of
the most important model content note terms marked with are also model concepts which link to content you might have
visited before lightbulb grey lightbulb this example explains the usage of the reference model in pilot project that investigates the
big data strategies for the eiscat 3d research infrastructure the reference model serves as knowledge base to guide various research
activities eiscat the european incoherent scatter scientific association was established to conduct research on the lower middle and upper atmosphere
and ionosphere using the incoherent scatter radar technique this technique is the most powerful ground based tool for these research
applications next generation incoherent scatter radar system eiscat 3d is being designed the multi static radars to be used will
be tool to carry out plasma physics experiments in the natural environment novel atmospheric monitoring instrument for climate and space
weather studies and an essential element in multi instrument campaigns to study the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere it will be
world leading international research infrastructure using the incoherent scatter technique to study how the earth atmosphere is coupled to space
the design of the eiscat 3d opens up opportunities for physicists to explore many new research fields on the other
hand it also introduces significant challenges in handling large scale experimental data that will be massively generated at great speeds
and volumes during its first operation stage in eiscat 3d will produce 5pb data per year and the total data
volume will rise up to 40pb per year in its full operations stage in this challenge is typically referred to
as big data problem and requires solutions beyond the capabilities of conventional database technologies eiscat is currently considering the use
of science technologies to deliver strategies for handling its big data products advanced science infrastructure projects such as egi8 prace9
and their enabling technologies are making large scale computational capacities more accessible to researchers of all scientific disciplines emerging infrastructures
such as cloud systems proposed by the helix nebula project10 and by the egi federated cloud task force11 or the
data infrastructure to be provided by eudat12 will extend possibilities even further as potential of science partner for eiscat we
present egi egi was established in as europe wide federation of national computing and storage resources the egi collaboration is
coordinated by egi eu not for profit foundation created to manage the infrastructure on behalf of its participants national grid
initiatives and european intergovernmental research organisations resources in egi are provided by about resource centres from the ngis who are
distributed across countries in europe the asia pacific region canada and latin america these providers operate more than logical cpus
pb disk and pb of disk capacity13 to drive research and innovation in europe and beyond since february pilot project
has been set up within envri which establishes partnership between eiscat and egi aiming to identify and allocate solutions that
directly benefit eiscat 3d which can also be reused in other esfri projects involved in envri envri wp3 has been
involved in this investigation and uses the reference model to guide various research activities including analysis of the eiscat 3d
data infrastructure analysis of egi enabling services and construction of an integrated infrastructure identifying the gaps between the egi generic
service infrastructure with the functional requirements of the domain specific research infrastructure eiscat 3d having fulfilled these tasks the reference
model is proving to be useful as knowledge base that can be referred when conducting various system analysis and design
activities in the following we describe how the reference model is used to conduct several system analysis tasks the initial
challenge for the pilot project is to understand the eiscat 3d data infrastructure the existing design documents of eiscat 3d
has been focused on the incoherent scatter radar technologies as shown in figure its data infrastructure is embedded within the
overall design of the observatory system that is difficult for computer scientist technologist having little physics knowledge background to understand
figure the eiscat 3d data infrastructure maps to of envri common subsystems using the envri common subsystem to interpret the
eiscat 3d data infrastructure makes it easy to communicate with computer scientists technologists we use the envri common subsystem framework
to decompose the computational elements clarifying the boundary between the radar network and data infrastructure which results in figure this
diagram now instead of figure is frequently used in presentations and discussions of the eiscat 3d data infrastructure lightbulb figure
illustrates that the eiscat 3d functional components can be placed into envri common subsystems data acquisition and curation briefly at
the acquisition subsystem the raw signal voltage data will be generated by the antenna receivers at the speed of tb
hr and be temporarily stored in ring buffer second stream of rf signal voltages will be passed to beam former
to generate the beam formed data 1mhz continually the beam formed data will be processed by correlator to generate correlation
analysis data based on standard methods then the correlation data will be delivered to fitter to produce the fitted data
1gb year in order to support different user requirements eiscat 3d will allow users to access and process the raw
voltage data in the ring buffer and to generate the specialised products based on self defined analysis algorithms both raw
data and their products will be stored in intermediate storage 11pb year from where they will be delivered to the
central site within the curation subsystem in the curation subsystem long term storage will preserve the raw voltage data and
their products high performance computer will be used for data searching and processing beam forming lag profiling or other correlation
and parameter fitting searching facilities will enable user to search over all data products and to identify significant data signatures
multi static fitter will be installed to process the stored raw voltage data to generate the 3d plasma parameters that
will then be stored back in long term storage complete copy of long term storage data will be established at
mirror sites related data processing and searching tools will be provided while it is made clear that the design specification
covers of common subsystems described in the envri reference model including acquisition and curation we understand functionalities of the other
subsystems access processing and community support are currently missing the reason of this is likely due to resource limitations however
the absent subsystems are crucial for big data system such as eiscat 3d without providing services to support data discovery
access processing and user community the value of eiscat 3d big data cannot be unlocked and expensively generated and archived
scientific data will be useless using the reference model as the analysis tool we identified the missing pieces of the
design specification which gives the direction for future investigation analysis of egi enabling services and construction of an integrated infrastructure
we need to understand the functionalities of egi services and how to integrate them to support the eiscat 3d requirements
showing in table by examining the functionalities of the egi services and mapping them to the envri reference model computational
model objects we understand these services fall into envri common subsystems curation and community support above analysis gives clues to
solution for integrating the egi technologies into the eiscat 3d data infrastructure depicted in figure secondary data curation subsystem seen
as the mirror site of the eiscat 3d central archive in figure can be established using the egi infrastructure and
its services data from eiscat 3d central archive or the acquisition subsystem can be staged into the egi storages and
be managed using lfc file catalogue and amga metadata catalogue at the front end an eiscat science gateway can be
established seen as part of community support subsystem to provide access control authentication authorisation and single sign on and application
portals to which processing and data mining applications from eiscat 3d can be plugged in using the reference model functional
elements of both eiscat 3d and egi can be placed into uniform framework which provides way of thinking about the
construction of the integrated infrastructure evaluation of the feasibilities of the egi infrastructures and services in supporting eiscat 3d requirements
using the common framework enabled by the reference model we can analyse and compare the egi generic service infrastructure and
the requirements from domain specific data infrastructure such as eiscat 3d and we understand that there are significant gaps in
between including but not limited to staging services to ship scientific data from observatory networks into the egi generic service
infrastructure and to get the data off are missing such staging service should be able to transmit both big chunk
of data up to petabyte and continuing updates real time data streams during operations such service should satisfy performance requirements
including robust environmental scientific research needs high quality data in particularly during important natural events losing observation data is unaffordable
fault tolerance is desirable which requests the transmission service can be self recover from the interruption point without restarting the
whole transmission process fast in the case of eiscat 3d the 10pb ring buffer can only hold data for about
days and the big observation data need to be transferred to the archive storage fast enough to avoid being overwritten
cheap the observatory networks are remote from the egi computing farm using high capacity pipes are possible but expensive software
solutions such as intelligent network protocols optimisation data compression are desirable cost effective large storage facilities and long term archiving
mechanisms are urgently needed environmental data in particular for climate research need to be preserved over the long term to
be useful being grid oriented egi is not designed for data archiving purposes although large storage capabilities are potentially available
through ngi participants egi does not guarantee long term persistent data preservation curation services such as advanced data identification cataloguing
and replication are absent from the egi service list the egi infrastructure needs to adapt in order to handle emerging
big data phenomena the challenge is how to integrate what is new with what already exists services such as job
schedulers need to be redesigned to take into account the trade off of moving big data intelligent data partitioning services
should be investigated as way to improve the performance of big data processing advanced searching and data discovery facilities are
urgently needed it is often said that data volume velocity and variety define big data but the unique characteristic of
big data is the manner in which the value is discovered oracle unlike conventional analysis approaches where the simple summing
of known value reveals result big data analytics and the science behind them filter low value or low density data
to reveal high value or high density data oracle novel approaches are needed to discover meaningful insights through deep complex
search using machine learning statistical modelling and graph algorithms without facilities to unlock the value of big data expensively generated
and archived scientific data will be useless community support services are insufficient the big data phenomena will eventually lead to
new data centric way of conceptualising organising and carrying out research activities that could lead to an introduction of new
approach to conducting science new generation of data scientists is emerging with new requirements service facilities should be planned to
support their needs currently eudat has taken up the role to implement collaborative data infrastructure however only few services are
available storage facilities are insufficient and policies for usage are unclear among our current investigations we are investigating the possibility
of integrating eudat services into egi infrastructure seen as layer on top of the egi federated computing facility the analysis
of the eudat services is included in another usage example see example below of the reference model in this example
we have shown that the reference model could be used to conduct various system analysis tasks using the reference model
we have clarified the boundary of the eiscat 3d data infrastructure and identified the missing functionalities in the design provided
solution to integrate the egi services into eiscat 3d data infrastructure identified gaps between the egi generic service infrastructure with
the requirements from the domain specific research infrastructure eiscat 3d we have shown that the reference model offered research infrastructure
knowledge base containing useful information could be referred in various system analysis and design activities uniform platform into which computational
elements of different infrastructures could be fitted enabling comparison and analysis way of thinking of constructions of plausible system architectures
in the next we will explain different way of using the reference model in the analysis of the eudat services
example using the reference model as an analysis tool descriptions of the example this study case provide an example for
esfri environmental research infrastructures project managers and architects to use the envri reference model as an analysis tool to review
an emerging technology the eudat data infrastructure and its service components such an analysis can help them better understand the
newly developed technologies and decide on how to make use of the generic services provided in their own research infrastructures
the eu funded eudat project14 is developing pan european data infrastructure supporting multiple research communities such generic data infrastructure is
seen as layer in the overall european scientific infrastructure to complement the computing layer egi deisa15 prace16 and the networking
layer geant17 the design activities of eudat are driven by use case based community requirements eudat reviews the approaches and
requirements of different communities such as linguistics clarin18 solid earth sciences epos19 climate sciences enes20 environmental sciences lifewatch21 and biological
and medical sciences vph22 identifying common services and provides computational solutions initially services are provided within eudat data infrastructure safe
replication which enables communities to replicate datasets using the integrated rule oriented data system irods23 as replication middleware within data
centre sites with persistent identifiers automatically assigned to the digital objects in order to keep track of all the replicas
data staging which enables easy movement of large amounts of data between eudat storage resources and workspace areas on high
performance computing hpc systems to be further processed metadata catalogue which allows researchers to easily access metadata of data or
their collections stored in eudat nodes eudat will also harvest external metadata which contains pointers to actual data from stable
metadata providers to create comprehensive joint catalogue that will help researchers to find interesting data objects and collections simple storage
which allows registered users to upload òlong tailó data objects large in number but small in size and share such
objects with other researchers we use the concepts developed in the envri reference model to analyse the eudat data infrastructure
and its service components only cursory analysis is provided since the main purpose of the study case is to illustrate
the usage of the envri reference model the envri reference model models an archetypical environmental research infrastructure ri as service
infrastructure eudat itself is therefore not an implementation of the reference model but is rather source of implementations for instances
of objects required by any ri implementing the model from the computational perspective eudat offers services that can be used
to instantiate various objects in the reference model for example eudatõs safe replication facilities can implement various required services within
the data curation subsystem of an environmental ri grey lightbulb grey lightbulb acquisition eudat does not offer facilities for data
acquisition relying on data already gathered by client ris lightbulb lightbulb curation eudat can provide instances of any of the
computational objects used for data curation including data store controllers data transfer services and catalogue services either in place of
or complementary to instances provided by an environmental ri the extent to which eudat assumes the curation role for an
infrastructure will vary from case to case grey lightbulb grey lightbulb grey lightbulb grey lightbulb access data access to eudat
curated data is brokered by eudat whilst the ri would broker ri curated data in practice the ri broker would
sit in front of the eudat broker forwarding data requests that involve data delegated to eudat grey lightbulb lightbulb processing
eudat do not offer data processing beyond metadata annotation as core service workflow enactment is being investigated as future service
however which would allow later version of the eudat platform to implement elements of data processing subsystem grey lightbulb lightbulb
whilst certain aspects of eudat such as the simple store for researchers might be directly accessible as an independent gateway
service in general eudat sits behind client ri its services hidden behind the riõs native services from the perspective of
the riõs user community it would be likely however that the ôvirtual laboratoriesõ by which community groups interact with an
ri would be in some way augmented by eudat services in particular implementations of the security service would integrate the
eudat aai service to allow seamless integration of eudat held datasets with locally held ri datasets lightbulb lightbulb the most
immediately apparent conclusion that can be drawn from cursory analysis of eudat services in the context of the reference model
is that eudat can potentially implement the entire data curation subsystem of an environmental ri however in practice one would
expect that an ri would retain certain amount of data locally particularly raw data that is expensive to transfer off
site necessitating more nuanced grey lightbulb division of labour between the ri and eudat in particular eudat provides replication services
allowing the co existence of ri and eudat data stores holding the same data and eudat provides metadata including global
persistent identifier services allowing eudat to provide catalogue service probably complementary to any catalogue service maintained by an environmental ri
itself the delegation of services will be product of negotiation between the environmental ri and the eudat project some degree
of automation may be possible but likely sufficient for only smaller projects grey lightbulb the principal potential benefit of using
the reference model in general is the ability to precisely identify components required by an environmental ri and then identify
how if at all the ri implements those components in the eudat context eudat provides number of services that implement
certain components primarily in data curation it should therefore be possible to identify the equivalent services in modelled ri and
determine whether or not there is benefit to delegating those services to eudat this decision may be based on cost
particularly related to economies of scale and development time in cases where the ri has not yet implemented the service
but may be able to use the eudat service instead grey lightbulb researchers and architects of an esfri environmental research
infrastructure often encounter requests to describe their infrastructure to introduce its particular architectural features or to explain system requirements the
reference model offers set of ready to use terminology with explicit definitions which can be applied to various documentations this
example tells how the reference model has been used as common language in writings to communicate with community other than
environmental science the research data alliance rda community is established to accelerate international data driven innovation and discovery by facilitating
research data sharing and exchange use and re use standards harmonization and discoverability this will be achieved through the development
and adoption of infrastructure policy practice standards and other deliverables envri has been actively supporting the rda activities and made
various contributions in particular envri has been accepted as one of the use cases by the rda data foundation and
terminology dft working group which has been set up to gather emerging requirements as well as to test research outcomes
in preparing the use case researchers and architects from two envri participating research infrastructures emso and epos used the terms
and concepts defined in the reference model to describe architectural features of their research infrastructures the resulting document from emso
is presented below the european research infrastructure emso is european network of fixed point deep seafloor and water column observatories
deployed in key sites of the european continental margin and arctic it aims to provide the technological and scientific framework
for the investigation of the environmental processes related to the interaction between the geosphere biosphere and hydrosphere and for sustainable
management by long term monitoring also with real time data transmission since emso has been on the esfri european strategy
forum on research infrastructures roadmap it entered its construction phase in within this framework emso is contributing to large infrastructure
integration projects such as envri and coopeus the emso infrastructure is geographically distributed in key sites of european waters spanning
from the arctic through the atlantic and mediterranean sea to the black sea it is presently consisting of thirteen sites
that have been identified by the scientific community according to their importance respect to marine ecosystems climate changes and marine
geohazards the data infrastructure for emso is being designed as distributed system presently emso data collected during experiments at each
emso site are locally stored and organized in catalogues or relational databases run by the responsible regional emso nodes the
emso data architecture is currently adapted to the envri reference model as shown in figure according to the envri rm
it includes the envri common subsystems concepts and terms defined in envri rm are used to illustrate the currently practiced
common data management strategies for real time as well as archived data within the emso distributed data management system the
emso data acquisition sub system collects raw data from emsoõs marine observatories which represent sensor arrays of varying geometry and
various instruments or human observers and brings the measures data streams into the system set up and design of each
observatory is specified depending on the scientific demands and includes specification of sampling designs and measuring method grey lightbulb depending
on the deployment situation and nature of collected data emso data is acquired in real time or delayed mode both
data collection methods are performed by the regional nodes of emso that are responsible for the operation of marine observatories
marine observatories have to deal with many technological challenges due to their extreme deep sea deployment locations therefore data acquired
by marine observatory sensor systems is most often temporarily staged within the instruments or the observatoryõs internal storage systems and
real time transmission of data is only provided by observatories that are connected by submarine cables or permanent satellite connections
whereas real time data are immediately available the staged data becomes available for these systems only after visits during dedicated
ship expeditions when the instruments are recovered or maintained in addition data are acquired through laboratory studies performed on material
or samples collected at marine observatory sites such as multidisciplinary analyses of water samples sediment cores tow or trap catches
depending on the instrumentation and observatory design on site quality control and data filtering is applied generally followed by transformation
process which converts the instrument specific data format into transmission format required by emsoõs data curation and data processing systems
at the regional data centre nodes the data collected by the data acquisition sub system are transmitted to the data
curation sub system to be maintained and archived there the emso data curation sub system facilitates data curation quality control
and preservation of scientific data it is operated at the data centres responsible for archiving the data acquired by the
emso regional nodes three major data centres are currently offering these services for emso data unihb pangaea ingv moist and
ifremer eurosites data import services are provided by these institutions which either transfer the above mentioned data transmission format into
an archival format or provide editorial tools and interfaces to ingest delayed mode data and laboratory analysis into their systems
data which are intended to be transferred to the regional nodes data archives are quality checked linked with an appropriate
set of metadata according to international standards and persistently identified depending on the archives internal standards and procedures emso offers
catalogue services and metadata export services for each regional node the node systems pangaea and moist services based on metadata
standards such as iso19115 gcmd dif and extended dublin core for eurosites data metadata is extracted from netcdf files via
central emso service data export services are not yet fully implemented at all emso nodes however it is planned to
provide netcdf export services for each node the regional archives are responsible for cataloguing and long term the emso data
access sub system enables discovery and retrieval of data housed in data resources managed by data curation sub system emso
offers data discovery via common metadata catalogue and web portal25 the portal is based on the brokerage system panfmp26 and
uses open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting oai pmh or simple file transfer via ftp http to harvest metadata
from emsoõs distributed regional node data archives and their archival systems pangaea moist and eurosites the emso data portal offers
machine human as well as machine machine search facilities and discovery services based on the collected metadata this includes simple
web based user interface data search engine offered at the emso data portal in google like style in addition the
data portal offers common discovery service following the opensearch specification including the opensearch geo extension an open geospatial consortium ogc
catalogue service for web cs interface is currently under development centralized data export service for these archived data is not
implemented or planned therefore unless each emso data archive offers its own netcdf data transformation service see above data requests
are not yet processed by the emso data portal but are redirected to the hosting data archives which provide their
own data access services for data retrieval access to real time data is also offered via the emso data portal
emso has chosen to implement core standards of the ogc sensor web enablement swe suite of standards such as sensor
observation service sos and observations and measurements to deliver real time data these interfaces and formats are used to offer
common web based sos client that provides interactive visualizations of real time data centralized data processing sub systems that aggregate
the data from various resources and provides computational capabilities and capacities for conducting data analysis and scientific experiments are not
yet implemented for emso once more regional emso nodes and their data archives support netcdf data export it has been
envisaged to introduce data visualization and plotting services at the emso data portal following the esonet example however presently data
processing services such as visualization mining as well as statistical services are exclusively provided by each regional node and its
responsible data centre centralized community support sub system services to manage control and track users activities and supports users to
conduct their roles in communities are not yet implemented or planned for emso the emso example demonstrates how to use
the common language defined by the reference model in documentation to communicate with the rda community it has been recognised
there is common challenge when communicating with external organisations or communities òyour model is not my model your data is
not my with public accessible reference base an external community that has little domain knowledge such as rda is able
to understand the specific descriptions of emso by looking up the terminology in the reference model in way using the
reference model the communication efficiency can be improved the envri reference model provides set of ready to use terminology in
principle terms in the science viewpoint can be used for describing requirements use scenarios and human activities terms in the
information viewpoint for describing information objects handled in system their action types constrains states and lifecycles and terms in the
computational viewpoint for describing functionalities computational components interfaces and services reader may have noticed there are some terms in the
writing that are different from the ones linked back in the reference model for example òset up of each observatory
is linked to òinstrument configurationó the intention is to show that in practice to pursue the fitness significance or beauty
of the writing an author may use different vocabularies to express single concept however one can link them to the
related concepts and definitions in the reference model to indicate the precise meanings in this sense using the reference model
is different from using dictionary referring to the reference model places more emphasis on conceptual relativity although it looks similar
this example provides difference perspective on the usage of the reference model to that of example the envri reference model
is characterised by being both an ontology and model while example demonstrates how to make use of its ontological framework
in documentation in this example we exploit its representation as model which enables structural thinking and is more useful in
the construction of an infrastructure and the organisation of design activities the european plate observing system epos is the european
integrated solid earth sciences research infrastructure long term plan to integrate existing national research infrastructures for seismology volcanology geodesy and
other solid earth sciences one of epos goals is to provide the technical and legal framework by which to automate
discovery and access to datasets and services provided by existing national and trans national research institutions and monitoring networks throughout
europe another goal is to provide standard set of core services by which researchers and other interested parties can interact
with the federated infrastructure independently of the any particular data centre or national infrastructure by providing such common service interface
and federation of resources epos will be able to provide greater access to data recorded by existing and future monitoring
networks laboratory experiments and computational simulations and foster greater cross disciplinary research collaborations epos was included in the european strategy
forum on research infrastructures esfri roadmap in december and is currently in its preparatory phase epos is scheduled to enter
its construction and operational phase in epos is an infrastructure that intends to integrate several existing infrastructures that in the
past have generally been constructed on national scale only there already exist established data centres with established working practices and
monitoring networks the challenge for epos is to provide lightweight service layer that can be placed over these existing established
infrastructures whilst disguising the underlying heterogeneity of components this challenge is at least partially mitigated by the existence of certain
protocols and data formats that are already standard in some parts of for example seismology and general drive within epos
to further extend standardisation throughout its constituent institutions though it is not clear how extensively this level of standardisation will
apply to all of the currently highly disparate earth sciences covered by epos remit it is intended that envri contribute
in some way to the design of the epos core services whether by the production of useful tools via envri
wp4 or by the application of the envri reference model envri rm for infrastructure layout and design via envri wp3
focusing on the latter envri rm should be able to simplify the design problem by breaking it down into well
defined subsystems of components specified from different complementary viewpoints following the guidance of the envri common subsystems the epso design
issues can be broken down as follows grey lightbulb data acquisition is performed by epos constituent client infrastructures existing monitoring
networks and laboratories collected by data centres and presented for discovery and access to the epos integration layer many of
these client systems operate in real time for example the continuous data streams produced by seismograph networks requiring concurrently active
data curation facilities storage persistent identification and metadata assignment data is principally curated within existing data centres that publish their
datasets according to some agreed protocol these data centres have their own data collection policies but epos intends to promote
the adoption of common metadata in order to ease interoperation based on three level model consisting of discovery metadata using
extended qualified dublin core which is derived from contextual metadata using cerif the common european research information format which points
to detailed metadata domain specific and associated with particular service or resource epos will also provide global persistent identification mechanism
for continuous data streams and discrete datasets the latter possibly using the mechanisms produced by the eudat project given global
persistent identification and metadata as well as the use where possible of standard data formats it is intended that tools
be produced to search over and extract specific datasets from different sites based on geospatial and other requirements this along
with tools for modelling processing data mining and visualisation form the data oriented integration layer of the epos core services
these sit atop the thematic layer of the services which divide services by domain and forms for example seismology volcanology
and geodesy as well as satellite data hazard maps geomagnetic observatories and rock physics laboratories because epos is making concerted
effort to integrate data standards and services the resultant infrastructure should be less reliant on the brokering model than otherwise
expected the homogenisation of resources means that it will not be so necessary to maintain interfaces between heterogeneous resources required
to be interoperable epos also intends to provide access for researchers to high performance computation facilities as provided by such
infrastructure projects as prace epos intends to provide training facilities to its research demographic it is as yet unclear if
epos intends to provide any kind of social aspect to its core services annotation of datasets record of individual researchers
interactions with the infrastructure etc it is goal however of epos to promote best practices and reward participation as well
as to increase the visibility of research results produced using epos services this implies that community support will become an
increasingly important aspect of the epos infrastructure as the basic integration challenge it faces becomes solved like epos esfri environmental
research infrastructures are characterised as large scale distributed complex systems involving numbers of organisations across different european countries design and
implementations become large collaborative activities subjective to change and are evolving which bring significant challenges considering the difficulty of ensuring
efficiency and productivity it is not only what to do but how to do it that is important we observe
no efficient approach is currently in use to assist the organisation of the design activities the envri reference model captures
common requirements of collection of representative environmental research infrastructures providing projection of europe wide requirements they have which in potential
can be served as technology roadmap to position and orchestrate collaborations in design and developments it provides well defined subsystems
of components specified from different complementary viewpoints science information and computation which can help break down the complexity and simplify
the design problems enabling designers to deliver practical architecture that leads to concrete implementations it offers descriptive framework for specifying
uniform distributed systems allowing designers from different organisations to carry out design activities in parallel envri working package responses to
deliver common services to support the constructions of esfri env ris initially the implementations focus on data access subsystem that
supports integrated data discovery and access in order to help esfri project managers architects and developers understand the design and
implementation of these services this example uses the terms and concepts from the reference model to explain the technology details
of these services grey lightbulb we start with the semantic harmonisation service developed by the team in task tarasova the
development is conducted to support the use case iceland volcano ash the goal is to support scientists to analyse iceland
behaviour using data provided by different research infrastructures during specific time period defined by the reference model science viewpoint the
semantic harmonization is behaviour belong to the data publication community which captures the business requirements of unifying similar data knowledge
models based on the consensus of collaborative domain experts to achieve better data knowledge reuse and semantic interoperability data publication
community interacts with data access subsystem to conduct user roles the computational specification of the data access subsystem is given
the model specifies data access subsystem which provides data broker that act as intermediaries for access to data held within
the data curation subsystem as well as semantic brokers for performing semantic interpretation these brokers are responsible for verifying the
agents making access requests and for validating those requests prior to sending them on to the relevant data curation service
these brokers can be interacted with directly via virtual laboratories such as experiment laboratories for general interaction with data and
processing services and semantic laboratories by which the community can update semantic models associated with the research infrastructure lightbulb data
broker object intercedes between the data access subsystem and the data curation subsystem collecting the computational functions required to negotiate
data transfer and query requests directed at data curation services on behalf of some user it is the responsibility of
the data broker to validate all requests and to verify the identity and access privileges of agents making requests it
is not permitted for an outside agency or service to access the data stores within research infrastructure by any means
other than via data broker an experiment laboratory is created by science gateway in order to allow researchers to interact
with data held by research infrastructure in order to achieve some scientific output grey lightbulb semantic broker intercedes where queries
within one semantic domain need to be translated into another to be able to interact with curated data it also
collects the functionality required to update the semantic models used by an infrastructure to describe data held within grey lightbulb
semantic laboratory is created by science gateway in order to allow researchers to provide input on the interpretation of data
gathered by research infrastructure grey lightbulb please click the links to find out the specification details of these computational objects
and the interactions between them the implementation conducted by wp4 t4 is an instantiation of the above computational objects specified
in the reference model that uses existing software components and developed approaches to enable integration and harmonization of data resources
from clusterõs infrastructures and publication according unifying views the prototyped service uses two semantic models to provide mapping between representations
the rdf data cube vocabulary29 and the envri vocabulary30 the envri vocabulary is derived from the ogc and iso òobservations
measurementsó standard sweet32 and geosparql vocabulary33 table provides the mapping between reference model computational objects and the deployed service components
among them the transformation component serves as data broker to negotiate data access with data stores within heterogeneous research infrastructures
an instance of the semantic broker is implemented using the rdf store technology which provides the semantic mappings and translations
in the following we explain the design of the information model of the semantic harmonisation service analysing the environmental data
schema results in identifying the common structural concepts the envri vocabulary which include the terms such as òmetadata attributesó òobservationó
òdatasetó data retrieved from the different sources are firstly mapped to this uniform semantic model figure gives two examples and
shows how datasets of icos and euro argo can be mapped to the envri vocabulary respectively semantic mappings are based
on observation statements for example the following observation statement declares the measurements about òairó òobservation of the co2 concentration in
samples of air at the mace head atmospheric station which is located at 53_20 9_54 co2 concentration of the air
25m above the sea level on jan 1st at was parts per million air is represented as the concept of
air in general multi lingual environmental thesaurus gemet by assigning the uri34 to it entity naming the gemet concept of
air is then defined as an instance of envri featureofinterest entity typing the mapping rules are specified by using the
data cube plug in for google refine the mappings are executed to obtain rdf representations of the source data files
as such they are uploaded to the virtuoso ose rdf store35 and are ready to be queried at sparql endpoint
the data harmonization process described above is captured by the reference model as shown in figure the information viewpoint models
the mapping of data according to mapping rules which are defined by the use of local and global conceptual model
ontologies and thesauri are defined as conceptual models and those widely accepted models such as gemet data cube are declared
global conceptual models whereas the envri vocabulary is specified as local one because it has been developed within the current
project without being yet accepted by broad community describing process using the envri reference model concepts is to instantiate the
concepts that can be mapped to the process figure illustrates the instantiation all boxes with dashed line of the envri
reference model information model concepts focusing at the harmonization process described above the same could be demonstrated for the euro
argo dataset with the feature of interest being ocean for each part of the observation mapping rules have to be
defined to be able to query both datasets at certain time period table and show the mapping between the harmonisation
process and the concepts in the envri rm information viewpoint the example shows that both bottom up from the applied
operation to the model description and top down approaches from the model definitions back to the applied solution can lead
to better understanding of the reference model itself and of how components should work properly in complex infrastructure for example
òobservation of the co2 concentration in samples of air at the mace head atmospheric station which is located at 53_20
9_54 co2 concentration of the air 25m above the sea level on jan 1st at was parts per millionó this
example demonstrate the feasibility of the design specifications of the reference model instances of selected model components can be developed
into common services in this case data access subsystem is implemented that supports integrated data discovery and access data products
from different environmental research infrastructures initially including icos and euro argo can now be pulled out through single data access
interface37 scientists are using this newly available data resource to study environmental problems previously unachievable including the study of the
climate impact caused by the eruptions of the eyjafjallaj kull volcano in grey lightbulb in this guideline we have used
set of practical examples to illustrate various ways of using the envri reference model we have chosen scenarios familiar to
the esfri environmental research infrastructures community and provided analysis that may be of interest and benefit to their daily work
throughout the document we have incrementally introduced model concepts and terminology and guided the reader to explore of the most
important contents described by the reference model using number of examples we have shown that by using the reference model
esfri environmental research infrastructure could benefit from set of ready to use terminology with publicly accessible reference base which can
be used to describe requirements and architectural features of an infrastructure and serve as common language in communication materials in
particular with an external community without any specific knowledge of the scientific domain being addressed uniform framework with well defined
subsystems of components specified from different complementary viewpoints science information and computation which promotes structural thinking in constructions of system
architectures and can be used as research tool for comparison and analysis of heterogeneous infrastructures knowledge base capturing existing requirements
and state of the art design experiences the information provided can be referred to in various system analysis tasks to
guide design and implementation activities and to drive the development of common services when future resources become available we will
conduct more investigations including we will assist our users to get hand on the reference model and exploit new ways
of using it we will continue the investigation of the big data pilot project with eiscat 3d and report back
new discoveries we have also received the requests from icos and we will help icos to apply the model concepts
to their daily tasks in various system analysis and design tasks or to guide implementations in similar way we will
interact with other esfri env ris in particular we are interested in how to use the reference model framework to
improve the interoperability among the heterogeneous infrastructures we will assist the development of the common services more detailed guide of
how to use the reference model to drive the implementations in wp4 will be provided we will use the reference
model to bridge esfri env ris with external communities such as rda projects such as geoss dataone eudat and egi
and standards such as inspire ogc and the digital library reference model these will provide esfri env ris an overview
of related technologies and possible solutions for the integrations we also have plan to experiment with the reference model as
guide to train the next generation data scientists
