the observation and understanding of environmental and earth systems requires global collaboration and significant contributions will come from all parts
of the planet should envriplus join forces with others globally to create and build an intellectual meeting place where this
collaboration is nurtured and crystallised by agreeing and adopting the relevant standards globally this would help with the boundary crossing
needed see section and in the longer term develop strong foundations for global campaigns to address pressing challenges some environmental
disciplines have their own standard setting international bodies such as tdwg for ecology and biodiversity211 and sometimes have collaboration with
similar bodies envriplus may want to initiate an exploratory meeting to consider developing sufficiently broad and effective framework within one
of them or cooperate with similar organisations to steer and develop global alliances such an intellectual meeting place could act
as complement from the ris perspectives to the belmont forum212 the world collective of major and emerging funders of global
environmental change research is the envriplus board of european environmental research infrastructures beeri the seed from which such forum can
grow what can envriplus best do to help combining both statistical and numerical methods the background to this is summarised
in section many disciplines and research groups in the environmental and earth sciences are benefitting from growing wealth of observational
data these data remain sparse and suffer from gaps where observation is difficult high error rates in some cases and
in almost all cases shortage of elapsed time for understanding dynamics statistical methods such as machine learning are very powerful
at gleaning information from such data numerical models are extremely powerful at representing current understanding and enabling researchers to explore
its consequences bringing these two paradigms of studying nature into one framework often yields substantial progress perhaps best illustrated in
the climate modelling campaign edwards envriplus or maybe even an extended cohort of ris should lead the formation of theoretically
well founded and systematic approach to their combination it would be nice example of reason for establishing an envriplus think
tank possibly it should lead to proposals for new european collaborative projects developing the necessary methods and their implementation new
culture is needed the ris of envriplus could lead in its foundation sharing computationally expensive results as the scale and
resolution of simulations are improved and as the scope and scale of statistical analyses increases the time and energy needed
to produce results grows substantially consequently there are powerful reasons for sharing intermediate and final outputs from these computations that
enables many researchers to explore and evaluate the data who would not be able to raise the resources to regenerate
them ii it encourages inspection and validation of the scientific method and its application in these circumstances and iii when
it avoids regeneration it saves substantial energy to achieve this in fields where it isn established practice requires agreement on
the representation of the data and the required metadata so that others can interpret them correctly mechanisms for storing publishing
and curating these data with associated policies business model to support the data storage access and analysis for publically announced
predetermined periods these should probably fall within the scope of arrangements for curation see sections and however new modus operandi
and business model may be needed for some expensive computations the data involved are massive this means the movement of
the data they produce is prohibitively expensive and analyses of them can also be expensive so storage of the bulk
of data may need to be close to its computational source and the curation system may only hold the reference
to it plus the metadata for these large data cases the computations exploring and analysing the results also need to
be co located with those data but funding that supports the simulations may not support the storage and subsequent analyses
as few moves as possible should occur during the lifecycle of these massive data sets finally the duration of retention
may be quite finite months and often pre specified this is partially to reduce storage and access costs but also
because such result sets tend to be overtaken by re runs with improved models or source data there are many
lessons to be drawn from numerical weather prediction and climate modelling in this regard edwards data intensive federation support the
background to this is summarised in section almost every ri is developing or depending on data intensive federation dif bringing
together heterogeneous data resources from independent and autonomous organisations some of these organisations are participating in many difs and many
of the organisations have priorities and rules imposed by their governments constitutions or funders that mean they can only participate
fully if those factors are properly considered and compliance with data and resource usage rules can be enforced or trusted
consequently frameworks that facilitate the establishment and operation of such difs would be widely used and very worthwhile within its
project lifetime it is infeasible for envriplus to conduct the necessary to create reusable and configurable dif framework from collaboration
rules to technological support however envriplus could spark campaign to get the eu to recognise the long term importance of
this issue for data driven science and business building on prior work of relevance camarinha matos patel atkinson 2013a it
might then join or lead research campaign to build the necessary foundations and to launch the necessary with engagement from
the it industry software sustainability the background to this is summarised in section the decision to depend on software is
as important as the decision to depend on an instrument and it should be taken equally carefully this will lead
to an identified list of mission critical software each ri and envriplus should establish mechanisms for determining that critical list
the list should be minimised by careful use of commercial and well supported open source software the members of the
residual list of software must be maintained or replaced throughout each ri lifetime this requires appropriate resources particularly software engineering
staff and processes with appropriate quality controls wherever possible these should be met through alliances promoting ict harmonisation the background
aspects to this have been covered in sections and both software sustainability and engineering tooling are identified as critical issues
affecting productivity and overall lifetime costs of ris software and the means to engineer and maintain it is expected to
assume significant and increasing proportion of overall costs indeed the overall cost of the ict needed to support the production
acquisition curation publishing and processing of data throughout its lifecycle should never be underestimated there is significant economy of scale
benefit from promoting ict harmonisation across ris wherever possible from interacting with foundational infrastructure providers like egi eu eudat prace
etc and from encouraging the adoption and use of commercial industrial engineering tools for development and maintenance promoting ict harmonisation
has the added benefit of opening new potential market for software and services for research infrastructures for research data lifecycle
management for scientific data collaboration data intensive federations etc to suggest but few that can be of interest to and
stimulate growth among smes by engaging in co development to handle the complexities of data diversity in federations of autonomous
data owners213 how should decisions be made the importance of making decisions about technical choices in the construction and maintenance
of the infrastructures for ris has been discussed and illustrated at the end of section with the many aspects that
should be considered and balanced presented in section as architects normally insist that their clients take such decisions carefully for
buildings many of the background issues are presented in section it is clear that making wise decisions about technological ict
choices is very important it can substantially affect costs viability sustainability and user experiences it requires clear policy context to
guide the preferred balance between conflicting pressures it requires investment in careful investigations it then requires decision by group with
the right mix of expertise and with proper understanding of the community requirements and priorities should this kind of decision
making be undertaken by each ri or will there be pooled effort making such decisions and taking into account potential
cost sharing and interworking at the very least the envriplus community and the ri communities should be agreeing on how
such decisions and policies are best made decision making is vitally important for software software is essential for all data
driven science and every member of the research community those supporting the communities and those exploiting the resulting information depend
upon it for their daily work software outlives hardware and even the business models by which computational provision is made
ris will live for long time with the decisions they make today about software choices or need to invest heavily
to replace software if it is deeply embedded references abbott abbott et al ligo scientific collaboration and virgo collaboration observation

from wikipedia the international meteorological organization was the first organization formed with the purpose of exchanging weather information among the
countries of the world it was born from the realization that weather systems move across country boundaries and that knowledge
of pressure temperature precipitations etc upstream and downstream is needed for weather forecasting it was superseded by the world meteorological
organization initially data was shared by posting to registered laboratories new magnetic tape master each month with few authorised to
approve additions to the master https www elixir europe org http www ivoa net some of the environmental research infrastructures
deal with physical systems but here they are complex and as exemplified by solid earth and climate sciences have to
deal with the complexities that come from deep history and many interacting systems mayr was jousting at particle physics where
the previous history of particle does not normally affect its behaviour https wiki envri eu display ec envri ri requirements

science mission and operations http www software ac uk http www apache org specific observation networks have been doing good
job refining their methods and delivering their data for years however engaging with this within the reference model framework will
enable new data usage and identify opportunities to pool resources this should not inhibit rapid developments of specific solutions and
boundary crossing understanding achieved by agile design and development methods there very focused approach breaks through barriers and creates an
immediately adoptable prototype once the solution is understood in this particular context standing back and casting it in higher level
terms enables others to draw on the understanding generated and it enables the originators to plan the future path to
general deployment and production engineering this will be helped by reference model expert joining in some of the agile campaigns
