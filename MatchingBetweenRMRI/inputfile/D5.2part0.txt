due date october m18 actual date of submission january m21 abstract the former envri project fp7 made an analysis of
the characteristics and requirements of six environmental research infrastructures ris to identify commonalities and contrasts of function this led to
the design of the envri reference model an integrative reference approach that the environmental research community can use to secure
interoperability between infrastructures to enable reuse of common components to permit sharing of resources and to provide common language of
communication between those responsible for the design and construction of research infrastructures the present report starts from the conclusions of
envriplus deliverable d5 òa consistent characterisation of existing and planned risó principally sections and to further address the issues of
assessing the requirements of the new larger group of ris represented in the envriplus project and whether these dictate revisions
to the existing viewpoints of the reference model developing the reference model further especially so that it can be used
to formalise critical aspects of the architecture for interoperability between ris and for collaborative construction and maintenance involving multiple organisations

earth system research infrastructures projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create coherent interdisciplinary and interoperable cluster of
environmental research infrastructures across europe it is driven by three overarching goals promoting cross fertilisation between ris implementing innovative concepts
and devices across ris and facilitating research and innovation in the field of environmental understanding and decision making for an
increasing number of users outside the ris envriplus aligns its activities to core strategic plan where sharing multi disciplinary expertise
will be most effective the project aims to improve earth observation monitoring systems and strategies including actions to improve harmonisation
and innovation and generate common solutions to many shared information technology and data related challenges it also seeks to harmonise
policies for access and provide strategies for knowledge transfer amongst ris envriplus develops guidelines to enhance trans disciplinary use of
data and data products supported by applied use cases involving ris from different domains the project coordinates actions to improve
communication and cooperation addressing environmental ris at all levels from management to end users implementing ri staff exchange programs generating
material for ri personnel and proposing common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating the socio
economic impacts envriplus is expected to facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single ris and at
the inter ri european and global level it promotes efficient and multidisciplinary research offering new opportunities to users new tools
to ri managers and new communication strategies for environmental ri communities the resulting solutions services and other project outcomes are
made available to all environmental ri initiatives thus contributing to the development of coherent european ri ecosystem blank page table

version incorporating changes arising from use in practice as well as new developments since the previous version was published version
august changes have been made both to improve the rm generally and to respond to newly collected and analysed requirements
of the research infrastructures ri as such version is snapshot at stage in the evolution of the envri rm for
reference purposes by the principal stakeholders namely the ris themselves undertaken as part of task in work package wp of
the envriplus project this work is part of closely related group of work packages forming theme òdata for scienceó concerned
with the design development and implementation of infrastructure methods services and tools that will help ris more easily manage and
fully exploit their data the present report and the envri rm itself helps theme integrate and steer its work to
meet the priorities of the ris thus project beneficiaries and participants of theme constitute second audience the main advantage of
the envri rm over other kinds of reference model is that it has been developed specifically to address the needs
of environmental research infrastructures serving as knowledge base and transfer mechanism for ri professionals it assists to raise the level
of discourse in systems engineering and architectural design of icts for ris we have shown that the envri rm relates
to and complements other reference models including both explicit models such as those promoted by the open geospatial consortium ogc
and the group on earth observation system of systems geoss and models implicit in the work of the research data
alliance rda assessing the requirements of the new larger group of ris and whether these dictate revisions to the existing
viewpoints of the reference model is main topic of the present report enhancements have been introduced to the rm to
better support ri needs for data identification cataloguing product generation publication citation semantic harmonisation discovery and access provenance processing and
use changes have also been made to re orient the envri rm towards and align it with typical life cycle
model for research data internal self consistency of the rm has been improved the presentation style of the rm documentation
has been adjusted to make the concepts and vocabulary easier to comprehend developing the reference model further especially so that
it can be used to formalise critical engineering aspects of the architecture for interoperability between ris and for collaborative construction
and maintenance involving multiple organisations is the next major step of evolution to that end the engineering viewpoint approach defines
ôinteraction pointsõ for achieving interoperability between parts of an ri or between ris at which interfaces can be defined it
recommends metadata driven ôbrokered service oriented architecture soa as the preferred future architectural style for interoperability from the technology perspective
the rm will encourage use of and foster seamless integration with shared european infrastructures including the european open science cloud
eosc there are several possible further enhancements of the rm by which it can gain value including the provision of
support for research campaigns canonical metadata models provenance tracking scientific workflows and data management plans of these the last data
management plans offers the most immediate addition of value that can be beneficially exploited by the ris introduction the envri
reference model envri rm is an enabling tool framework ôcontext for participationõ that helps the environmental research infrastructures ri to
achieve their shared goals of cross fertilisation harmonisation and innovation between ris generating common solutions to many shared information and
communications technology ict and data related challenges the envri rm achieves this by offering defined vocabulary for communication between participants
and set of conceptual relationships between those terms as the basis for creating common understanding and language for discourse in
its details the envri rm has been elaborated based on reverse engineering ris eiscat 3d emso epos euroargo icos lifewatch
to determine the functionalities these ris possess in common these functionalities have been modelled according to three principal viewpoints scientific
informational computational informed by general standardised model for òopen distributed processingó odp iso iec minimal model of common functions of
research infrastructure within the context of common life cycle for research data has been documented http envri eu rm1 to
serve as guide for systems architects and others the envri rm has been one of the successful outcomes from the
original envri project ec grant agreement but with limited exploitation and use thus far its potential is therefore latent the
envri rm has been further enhanced in the envriplus project to address wider range of ri needs specifically it has
been enhanced to better support ri needs for data identification cataloguing product generation publication citation semantic harmonisation discovery and access
provenance processing and use changes have also been made to re orient the envri rm towards and align it with
typical life cycle model for research data the present report records and explains those developments up to the date of
its publication for the record it includes snapshot of the corresponding version of the reference model see appendix page of
the present document concordance with the task description work package objective the work reported in the present document is described
as task in the description of activities of the envriplus project the relevant objective of the work package states that
it aims to òé promote interoperability among ris by providing novel envriplus reference model which should be developed not only
based on the existing envri rm but should also include the latest development insights from other successful ris the decision
has been taken at the commencement of the work to keep the name òenvri reference modeló as matter of maintaining
the existing market branding already receiving recognition in the areas to which it is targeted this is in accordance with
wider project decisions on promoting òenvri communityó as an overall brand for the community of the environmental research infrastructures projects
and networks as well as other diverse stakeholders interested in the environmental research infrastructure matters task description the task description
for work package task states òthe envriplus rm will be developed to be able to describe architectures at both the
conceptual level using semantic web lod and at the data performance level with the at any time the current and
most up to date published version of the envri reference model can be found at the following url http envri
eu rm former being generated from the latter to preserve integrity as demonstrated in the engage project the current envri
rm focuses on the design of small set of ris and was produced at time when most of them were
in their preparatory phase during the envri project ris made significant progress partly exceeding the expressiveness of the existing envri
rm the envriplus reference model takes input not only from the existing envri rm but also from the characterisation of
ris derived from task as well as from the contribution by task embedding the hes approach and from developments in
egi helix nebula and eudat this task will take actions to develop the envriplus rm based on the existing envri
rm and results from task connect the envriplus rm with other successful reference models adopted by existing ris or related
projects the marine biological association coordinates the dassh data archive centre which is national facility for the archival of species
and habitat data it needs to be integrated with other european marine biological data data curated by emso seadatanet jerico
and embrc as joint contribution to emodnet biology the copernicus provider this is typical test case and will help improve
the reference model the present report is principally concerned with the results of action this is reported in sections page

next steps in the evolution of the envri rm appendices provide supplementary information appendix page onwards contains full snapshot of
version of the envri rm taken on 9th november principal concepts used in the present document for an introduction to
the envri reference model the reader is referred to appendix beginning on page the sections on ògetting startedó òintroductionó and
òmodel overviewó provide comprehensive introduction to the model and its concepts zhao is an explanatory article of specific importance the
following principal concepts derived from terms defined in the iso iec series of international standards for open distributed processing odp
are used throughout the present document viewpoint on system form of abstraction achieved using selected set of architectural concepts and
structuring rules focusing on specific concerns within system cf the notion of different viewpoints as used in engineering and architectural
blueprints in the context of the present document the system is the ict system needed by an ri to support
its operations on data the environment within which that system operates is the specific ri it serves science viewpoint sv
viewpoint on system and its environment that focuses on the purpose business scope and policies for that system information viewpoint
iv viewpoint on system and its environment that focuses on the semantics of the information to be handled and the
information processing to be performed by that system in odp this viewpoint is referred to as the enterprise viewpoint but
in envri it has been named as the science viewpoint to more closely reflect that the business is science computational
viewpoint cv viewpoint on system and its environment that focuses on distribution through functional decomposition of the system into objects
that interact at interfaces engineering viewpoint ev viewpoint on system and its environment that focuses on the mechanisms and functions
required to support distributed interaction between objects in the system technology viewpoint tv viewpoint on system and its environment that
focuses on the choice of technology in that system viewpoints can be applied at an appropriate level of abstraction to
specify complete ri in the envri context in which case the environment defines the context in which the ri operates
the envri rm is minimal model representing the minimum set of most likely components to be found in an archetypical
ri in use the rm can be extended as far as needed for any specific ri viewpoints can also be
applied to individual components of ri in which case the component environment will include some abstraction of both the ri
environment and other system components abbreviations used in the present document cv computational viewpoint ev3 engineering viewpoint iv information viewpoint
ri research infrastructure plural ris rm reference model sv3 science viewpoint tv technology viewpoint connecting the envri rm with other
reference models adopted by existing ris and related projects the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university gives definitions for
reference model and reference architecture sei as follows reference architecture reference model mapped onto software elements that implements the functionality
defined in the reference model reference model division of functionality into elements together with the data flow among those elements
the sei definitions show that reference model is concerned with providing foundation to understand the functionalities of information systems at
high level meanwhile reference architectures are concerned with mapping the functionalities to set of software components there are many reference
models in use at least one for every software architecture model used for developing information systems wikipedia for example lists
examples wikipediaorg reference models concentrate on describing the issues that are most important in relation to the architectural model and
the types of applications to be built using that architecture for example the open systems interconnection basic reference model iso
iec is an example of general purpose reference model designed to support the development of distributed systems using different standard
communication protocols the open geospatial note that formally in odp the abbreviations nv and ev are used to denote the
engineering viewpoint and enterprise viewpoint respectively however in adaptation to the envri context we use ev to denote the engineering
viewpoint and sv to denote the science viewpoint see previous footnote also consortium reference model ogc orm is an example
of domain specific reference model designed to support specifying and implementing systems for geospatial services data and applications reference model
describes the common functionalities for the types of systems being described specific requirements that are important for domain are not
included in general purpose reference models while domain specific reference models address the concerns of specific domain offering further mapping
of requirements to existing solution strategies reference models supporting research infrastructures environmental research infrastructures are supported by ict systems that
should be developed following state of the art software engineering methods and architectures these presently include the application of layered
service oriented architecture soa and cloud architectural models4 such systems are under constant pressure to connect with other systems to
share data manage increasing quantities of data supporting growing research communities and respond rapidly to new problems in the environmental
ri domain multi tiered or layered architecture model is often used in structuring applications that include large quantities of data
backed up in database systems layered tiered architecture is based on the distribution of concerns the number of tiers can
vary but will at least separate aspects of presentation processes data access and physical resources clearly the reference model associated
with this architecture is mainly focused on the allocation of computing functions units to the identified layers and the relationships
between them in this reference model each layer except for the top layer provides services to the layer above it
the layered architecture model aims to clearly separate components that provide specific functionalities such as persistence of data implementation of
process rules or presentation details components in each tier collaborate directly with each other and can ask for services from
lower tier components some advanced infrastructures5 provide access to data sets using service oriented architecture soa framework soa helps to
organise and utilise distributed capabilities that can be provided by systems that are remotely located oasis the concepts of service
service provider and service consumer are important for this reference model and are terms that are often used in the
context of conversations about env ris and infrastructures soa helps the integration of remote sourced components in the form of
services the services can be provided by entities service providers that can be external or internal with respect to the
entities using those services service consumers european infrastructures provide services based on the soa model for example the b2xxxxx services
offered by eudat cloud computing is one current model for enabling access to shared pool of computing resources units in
the pool networks servers storage applications services can be rapidly deployed and provisioned with minimal management effort or service provider
interaction the definition of cloud computing provided by the national institute of science and technology nist nist can be seen
itself as basic reference model for cloud computing composed of five essential characteristics three service models and four deployment models
the essential characteristics on demand self service broad network access resource pooling rapid elasticity and measured service highlight the main
differences between cloud computing and traditional computing models the three service models group the services in layered structure with three
levels software platform and infrastructure as service with the corresponding acronyms saas paas and iaas the cloud deployment models describe
who owns and operates the cloud resources public private community and hybrid in the environmental ri domain ris are not
expected to develop their own cloud resources they are encouraged where appropriate to take advantage of the ri systems studied
during the requirements analysis phase of envriplus exhibit traits from these three architectural styles atkinson although not an env ri
in the context of the envriplus project the global biodiversity information facility gbif http www gbif org is an example
of an soa based infrastructure cloud computing resources provided by infrastructures such as those provided by egi eu and eudat
reference models support in relation to the domain in the environmental ri domain ict systems tend to follow the rm
principles of their main adopted architectural models during the development process the systems are designed to respond to specific requirements
from the institutions that sponsor them the layered soa and cloud architecture reference models help to explain and support important
engineering and technical solutions often the explanation of specific functional requirements for the environmental research domain cannot be documented or
explained directly without them the layered architecture reference model helps to explain the need for designing system components at different
levels depending on the functionalities they support this rm provides the best strategies to integrate systems that bring together different
technologies the soa reference model describes the components of service oriented systems and how they are integrated the focus of
this rm is usually the distribution of functionalities across institutional boundaries using networks the cloud architecture reference model describes the
fundamental principles for extending the use of distributed computing assets at infrastructure platform and software levels the focus of this
rm is on the technical requirements for extending systems that are deployed on distributed computing resources one focus of ris
is the sharing of research data with wide user base in this domain layered architectures can support the building of
backend systems used for the administration of ris and for cataloguing and publishing of data via web portals soa can
help ris to provide access to data sources using service application programming interfaces api cloud computing can help in provisioning
and scaling multiple services such as data transfer storage and processing however designing an ict system looking at these three
models in isolation from one another makes it difficult to see that system as single coherent entity in contrast the
envri rm presents unified view of the ri ict system as coherent whole supporting the aims of the research community
the odp model on which envri rm is based already considers bringing together different architectural models styles to construct the
complex distributed system the envri rm addresses the major types of ict and data oriented operations that given ri likely
needs to support it exposes and explains how concentrating on certain types of operations on data in each of the
phases of typical data life cycle model will help to determine what ris need provide with their icts medium term
we expect this new approach to reduce the cost of building maintaining and connecting ris by letting each ri concentrate
on its core competencies in house developed environmental ri systems are maintained by small ict staff teams and their most
common model is layered architecture in addition to these systems solutions provided by infrastructures service providers such as eudat and
egi can extend and complement in house ri systems offering services designed following mix of layered soa and cloud architectures
one of the greatest problems for ris is that they are developed as one of kind systems apart from data
sharing ris are not traditionally built for sharing and reuse of their engineered assets this development mode is in contrast
with current trends and proposals for shared infrastructures at national european and world levels hodson eosc rda 2016a the current
efforts by infrastructures offering shared solutions to common problems are an example of these trends however ris tendency to reinvent
rather than reuse existing assets leaves them unprepared for taking advantage of those solutions there is consequential loss of opportunities
for shared operational support and maintenance thereby reducing overall life cycle costs these considerations and those of section above lead
towards the engineering viewpoint proposals in section page below other reference models as mentioned before there are many reference models
moreover the emergence of customised models to address the needs of specific sectors gives rise to the appearance of domain
specific reference models this is why the discussion of the previous sub section focused on the models most well known
for the development of environmental ris however other models could also be used to provide the support that the envri
rm provides such as togaf togaf ogc orm ogc orm dl rm candela rm oais ccsds eurogeoss model santoro and
the emerging rda data fabric model rda 2016b togaf is general purpose reference model while the others are focussed towards
specific priorities such as representation of geospatial systems digital libraries systems of systems and research data sharing frameworks the open
group architecture framework togaf togaf is reference architecture designed to facilitate the construction of enterprise systems togaf has two associated
rms foundation architecture technical reference model fa trm and the integrated information infrastructure reference model iii rm fa trm describes
the generic services and functions that provide foundation on which more specific architectures and architectural components can be built the
iii rm is subset of the fa trm which expands the business applications and infrastructure applications parts to provide help
in addressing the need to design an integrated information infrastructure to enable unbounded information flow togaf is the like rm
odp and by extension envri rm because it also organises the description of enterprise systems in viewpoints which it calls
architectures as such togaf business architecture can be mapped to the enterprise viewpoint science viewpoint in envri rm the togaf
information systems architecture can be mapped to the information viewpoint the information system data architecture is equivalent to the computational
viewpoint the information system application architecture is equivalent to the engineering viewpoint and the technology architecture is equivalent to the
technology viewpoint from this perspective togaf could potentially be adapted to produce architecture and reference model like those developed by
envri ogc orm ogc orm is designed to specify and implement interoperable solutions for geospatial services data and applications including
sensor and sensor networks the relevance to risõ ict systems for environmental research is obvious this ogc orm also presents
the different perspectives for the description of systems the geospatial information section can be mapped to the information viewpoint the
geospatial services section is like the computational viewpoint the reusable patterns section can be mapped to the engineering viewpoint and
the ogc standards section can be mapped to the technology viewpoint the enterprise science viewpoint is the least developed of
the perspectives in ogc orm in this sense the ogc orm aims to keep generality in terms of applicability this
makes sense since geospatial services are important for multiple domains which may need to use them in different areas including
industrial research academic research government and commerce digital libaries reference model dl rm candela is designed to facilitate construction and
validation of digital libraries digital libraries are highly related to ris because both are based on the sharing of digital
data objects dl rm fosters the sharing of digital objects that include several forms of data including text images videos
and sound in addition to databases and metadata all these types of objects are important to ris the dl rm
also overlaps with the envri rm in terms of the functionalities for preserving curating publishing and using data digital objects
the acquisition and processing of data are the areas which dl rm does not support completely the presentation of the
dl rm is organised as domains each domain models set of aspects of digital libraries these domains are not comparable
to viewpoints one to one for instance the dl rm user policy and functionality domains have elements that can be
mapped to the science viewpoint in the envri rm while the architecture domain can be mapped to elements of the
computational engineering and technology domains many elements from all the dl rm domains can also be mapped to the information
viewpoint of the envri rm the dl rm is domain specific in the sense of focusing on the preservation curation
and publishing of data digital objects however these activities are important in multiple areas such as industrial research academic research
government and commerce the reference model for an open archival information system rm oais ccsds describes an archive that accepts
the responsibilities to preserve information and make it available for designated community the rm oais describes the responsibilities which distinguish
an oais archive using functional model consisting of six functional entities ingest archival storage data management administration preservation planning and
access the ingest archival storage data management and access functional entities participate directly in data processing the administration functional entity
provides functionalities for the operation of the archive the preservation planning functional entity provides functions and services to monitor the
oais rm oais describes the evolution of data in the archive as three types of information packages submission information package
sip archival information package aip and dissemination information package dip an information package is logical container composed of optional content
information and optional associated preservation description information associated with this information package is packaging information used to delimit and identify
the content information and package description information used to facilitate searches for the content information the main focus points of
the rm oais are the curation preservation publishing and use of data these focus points are closely related to the
same activities in the envri rm however envri also covers data acquisition regarding the depth of abstraction coverage the issues
addressed by oais are equivalent to the ones covered by the sv and iv while the rm also provides the
computational viewpoint which supports concrete it architecture model the long term preservation planning functional entity in oais which separates steering
management from administration is an important issue to consider for the further development of the envri rm which will be
needed by all ris and any subset that chooses to interoperate as discussed in section the geo group on earth
observation in its geoss global earth observation system of systems program has proposed model to extend the soa architectural model
using advanced brokering to facilitate the integration of research repositories into executable workflows santoro the approach proposes high level architecture
that can be used to integrate different data sources into dedicated pipeline starting from the definition of high level abstract
business process abp the building of workflow from the abp the execution of the workflow and the publishing of results
from execution in the context of environmental research infrastructures the geoss proposal could be used in three different areas defining
an acquisition curation publishing pipeline building processing tools supported by workflows and facilitating the integration of ris as data sources
the definition of an acquisition curation publishing pipeline scenario envisions the ri describing the acquisition curation and publishing tasks as
an abp the abp could then be converted into workflow and published in web portal for repeated execution in the
building workflow supported processing tools scenario an ri could define its data processing needs as an abp which in turn
could be converted into executable workflows and made available to users via web interface finally the facilitating the integration of
ris scenario could propose case in which group of ris define the integration of their repositories into different sets of
abps which in turn are built into workflows these workflows could then be exposed in common virtual research environment the
geoss proposal is complementary to the envri rm proposal the possibility of integration of ris proposed by geoss seems to
be the most relevant scenario the approach relies strongly on the existence of data repositories but does not go into
detail about how those repositories are built and sustained additionally the geoss brokering approach is presently late under consideration by
the rda data fabric interest group dfig rda 2016b as guide for the development of an architectural model the research
data alliance rda rda 2016a is an international organisation focused on the development of recommendations guidelines and community activities aimed
at reducing barriers to research data sharing and exchange and at promoting acceleration of data driven innovation worldwide the rda
addresses many of the same issues as the envri rm many of the interest and working groups within the rda
focus on topics that directly impact those addressed by the envri rm however so far rda does not provide reference
model for integrating the technical recommendations and standards in the development of systems within the rda the aim of the
data fabric interest group dfig rda 2016b is to build set of recommendations for integrating the rda outputs and facilitating
the building of systems to support data intensive research the same goal as the envri rm the goal of dfig
is to identify common components and define characteristics and services that can be used across boundaries to solve variety of
data scenarios such as replicating data in federations and developing virtual research environments the work of this interest group is
at an early exploratory stage however it is positioned to influence the way in which ri products data collections and
identification systems are integrated at high level consequently customising the outputs through the envri rm as they are developed can
prepare the environmental ri domain envri reference model for systems engineering of ris connecting the envri rm to the reference
models adopted by existing ris or related projects has been realised during the basic definition of the envri rm it
has exposed clearly the areas where the envri rm overlaps with other models the areas where they diverge and the
perceived advantages or disadvantages of each model the main advantage of the envri rm over other rms is that it
was developed specifically to address the requirements of environmental research infrastructures the adoption and use of reference models in the
environmental research domain for the development of research infrastructures has been limited thus far and not clearly oriented towards the
specific systems engineering level challenges of the domain the envri rm presents an approach aimed at addressing typical environmental research
requirements that is technology neutral the envri rm serves as knowledge base and transfer mechanism derived from domain knowledge that
can be mapped to technical standards and implementations used to define architectures for environmental research infrastructures we note that in
domains where rms are well embedded their respective communities recognise the importance of rms as mechanisms steer engineering in the
domain of environmental ris towards which the envri rm is targeted ris presently depend on internal and informal mechanisms to
steer their infrastructure design and development as they grow in complexity and as the inter ri issues are addressed this
requires the establishment of formal processes adjudicating the mappings of rms and other long term decisions to shape their support
for data driven science in the context of envri rm the formal process must be performed through longterm governance mechanism
for refining and updating the envri rm in this scenario the envri community is expected to eventually take up the
governance responsibilities validation of the reference model validation of the rm by attempts to use exploit it in different systems
design contexts is an essential part of understanding whether the rm has been specified correctly and of demonstrating its value
to stakeholders as part of the task work two implementation cases dassh and eufar are presently being studied jointly by
project experts and ris with the aim of describing aspects of two ris using the envri reference model rm this
will help to detect the rmõs limits and thus also support its general improvement the following subsections and report experiences
to date for work that is presently still in progress appendices and contain further background information on the two cases
the dassh validation case òwithin week could understand reference model concepts and the relation between viewpoints and can use the
model to frame the problem case it has become evident that the focus of the problem is on the sharing
of the published data from dassh into other kinds of systemsó dan lear head of data information and technology marine
biological association uk the dassh data archive centre is hosted at the marine biological association mba and is part of
the uk marine environmental data and information network medin data are routinely supplied to the uk national biodiversity network emodnet
biology network and gbif it is planned that the infrastructure will form part of the mbaõs contribution to the european
marine biological resource centre embrc the infrastructure has grown organically since in response to technological changes policy drivers and the
requirements of funders staff involved in the dassh data centre are typically marine biologists with some technical aptitude they are
not ict specialists the envri reference model presents an ideal opportunity to review the current systems and working processes practices
describe them in standard way facilitate integration with other infrastructures and assist in the identification of bottlenecks or areas for
improvement given the previous lack of experience with reference models in any form the initial challenge faced has been to
understand the overall concept of what reference model represents and the benefits of describing the dassh infrastructure in this manner
with the support of the team at cardiff university mba received comprehensive introduction to the rm and how it can
be applied with this basic understanding established the first task was to pick viewpoint and begin to map existing data
flow processes and systems to terms from the rm the science viewpoint was selected as the most accessible point of
entry and the one that most closely resembled existing data flow and process diagrams developed by dassh however choosing the
starting point of describing the infrastructure in the terms of the science viewpoint proved one of the hardest tasks the
available guidance does not help in the prioritisation or refinement of selecting path through the viewpoints and can leave the
na ve user unsure or unclear of the optimal mechanism for transcribing an existing set of processes and behaviours into
those terms available in the reference model whilst this lack of prescribed methodology represents strength and inherent flexibility for more
confident users of the rm it can leave new users with an intimidatingly òblankó canvas work on how best to
render the dassh infrastructure in terms of the rm was also needed the lack of mature or easily accessible tools
necessitated an initial paper based approach with this subsequently being interpreted to an electronic form it is unclear how to
best represent the correspondences between viewpoints further challenge especially for first time user of the reference model is assessing the
most appropriate level of detail at which to work this should be informed by the challenge or tasks that the
rm is being used to address however clearer guidance on both where to start and how much detail to include
would be beneficial mba opted to focus on the data publication elements of the dassh data life cycle as this
represents the interface with other infrastructures it is also the area where mba have identified an existing bottle neck in
the data flow process once starting point was selected and with help from the rm team at cardiff university mba
split and transcribed the existing data flows into the corresponding rm viewpoints moving from the science viewpoint to the information
and computational viewpoints the provision of suggested tool umlet6 and guidance on the recommended notation is also great help for
those users with no previous experience in uml or odp the experience of the data team at the mba in
learning and using the reference model can be summarised in the following points clearer simpler documentation using non specialist language
would greatly benefit the inexperienced user including how to illustrate correspondences more and varied examples would help define starting point
and the level of detail develop templates using the umlet tool or similar linked to examples and build community of
users who can share experience and support uptake the eufar experience using the envri reference model eufar works to coordinate
the operation of instrumented aircraft and remote sensing instruments exploiting the skills of experts in airborne measurements in the fields
of environmental and geosciences to provide researchers with the infrastructure best suited to their needs eufarõs networking activity òstandards and
protocolsó aims at contributing to the development of standards and recommendations to harmonise the structure and methods of operating research
infrastructures this will allow it to interact with eu integrating activities for environmental research actris iagos eurofleet etc in this
context envriplus is major driver and eufar has taken the opportunity to apply to serve as an implementation use case
for the envri reference model this predefined professional framework allows eufar to clearly define roles and processes in their research
infrastructure operations and helps to describe the current situation as well as to find missing and or duplicated actions this
activity will be of major benefit to eufar in preparing sustainable legal structure during the 3rd eufar ga meeting in
prague april the kick off of the cooperation between eufar and envriplus barbara magagna eea took place special session on
envriplus has been organized to introduce the purpose of the intended cooperation and to explain the rm in more detail
it has been decided that the eufar leaders of òstandards and protocolsó stefanie holzwarth dlr and òdatabaseó wendy garland stfc
work packages will be the persons in charge of implementing the rm for eufar both are experienced in using models
to map complex processes to start the implementation case requirements collection questionnaire version november provided by envriplus had to be
filled out concerning the seven theme vertical pillar topics of envriplus data identification and citation cataloguing etc the completion of
the questionnaire helped eufar experts to understand the wording of the rm and identify the different viewpoints several iteration processes
were necessary to finalise the input it became clear that some of the topics are out of scope for eufar
processing which is done by each data provider individually using the local infrastructure and tools assisted by eea magagna the
key eufar people started to collect all relevant modelled components of the science viewpoint into microsoft excel spreadsheet these are
communities roles and behaviours illustrated in table in appendix page sometimes it was not possible to do one to one
mapping of the eufar roles to the given science viewpoint roles further work is in progress on this aspect including
perhaps enhancing the ôstandard rmõ with roles specific to eufar this output has been used to create instances within the
oil_e ontology martin to make the eufar description comparable with other ri descriptions such as icos in principle but as
yet http www umlet com an open source java based uml tool designed for teaching the unified modelling language uml
and for quickly creating uml diagrams untested if one can use the same classes to define instances one can potentially
compare different descriptions data collection has been the initial focus of modelling since this is also the most relevant part
of eufar and therefore also the most familiar one the translation seemed to be easy looking at the result it
has become clear that some process steps must be described in more detail since more actors are involved in eufar
many different actors with different responsibilities are involved in relevant community behaviours thus it was decided to analyse the concept
of actor and its relationship to roles according to the implemented oil_e ontology this is illustrated in figure figure the
concept of actor and its relationship to roles in addition umlet diagrams are being produced to document the different elements
to be able to make transparent the different steps within the processes describing the behaviours activity diagrams are being produced
these diagrams indicate easily whether or not the interfaces between different actors are defined sufficiently the use of the diagrams
eases the iterative process of behaviour description the first behaviours analysed in these details are data collection data curation data
discovery and access user behaviour tracking the next focus of work will be the information viewpoint with the modelling of
the data life cycle of eufar datasets there are many relevant activities across eufar consortium members modelling these as the
science viewpoint has proved to be crucial to gaining better understanding of how these are distributed and in supporting internal
decision making assessment of validation progress the two validation cases described above have been in progress since early few general
conclusions can be drawn that supplement what is already known from earlier envri work approximately weeks of effort has been
invested by each team to initially learn the rm familiarise with concepts and outline some of their first thoughts on
design in both validation cases payback has been achieved quite early in the process in the dassh case this has
been to achieve thinking on the separation of different concerns in the eufar case it has been the realisation of
greater complexities than first imagined when working across multiple stakeholders adopting the rm approach is gradual process that shifts thinking
and mindset towards the systems oriented approach that is necessary when dealing with complex ict design and interoperability this is
known to some but not appreciated by many that are active in the ri arena once an initial understanding has
been acquired early adopter users of the rm are finding it helpful to consider their ri from different viewpoints and
that there are answers provided by the rm to most of the questions they have about their design the usefulness
and benefit of the rm is only as good as the available tools and the community of experts around it
growth will ease other peopleõs future experiences especially with the availability of more guidance materials based on practical examples and
visual representations this would help not only the early adopters but also the wider community while there is only small
user community at present without much contact and crossfertilisation between segments of it the envriplus project has planned number of
activities to address this issue materials aspects are being partially addressed in work package of the envriplus project by preparation
of training materials section below considers the community building aspect in more detail one recognized shortcoming of the validation cases
is that there is almost no resource effort to pursue them to their logical conclusions the participants are already finding
they could spend lot more time on them the perspective of validation must therefore be more long term allowing for
process of gradual enlightenment and adoption bringing about such change is slow which makes the process of rm validation slow
this is related to the lack of significant numbers of persons working in the ri arena that have previous experience
of ôthe commercial industrial levelõ of applying ict architecture and conceptual modelling processes and tools to large scale ri ict
design problems such persons are valuable and scarce but where they exist they facilitate matters in terms of marketing adopting
and gaining benefit of the rm the rm is by nature complex as is the process of research infrastructure ict
design appropriately skilled individuals are essential to the successful outcomes of ri design such individuals help to embed the work
in the target organisations which increases its value to those and increases survivability when project funding ends section page below
makes some suggestions for some further practical steps into practice for putting the rm to work in the envri community
developing the reference model further general improvements the opportunity has been taken to incorporate changes aimed at improving readability and
comprehension and to simplify the overall presentation of the rm this has been in response to feedback received about the
difficulty of becoming familiar with and getting something useful from the rm these changes have included re drawing of diagrams
re structuring of the page hierarchy in information and computational viewpoints and numerous typographical improvements nevertheless the reference model remains
an extensive technical document that requires some investment of time on the part of the reader to become familiar with
it re orientating around the data life cycle model explanation early versions of the rm and its viewpoints science information
computational had presented the model in sub systems oriented view of the world with hindsight we learnt that this emphasis
on subsystems early in the description of the rm makes the model appear more technical than it needs to be
sub systems more properly have their place in elaborating the computational and engineering viewpoints see section below whereas what is
needed in the introductory parts of the rm and in its science and information viewpoints is more business oriented view
additionally it is now thought useful to be able to show how the rm contributes to supporting typical activities in
the life cycle of research data implemented by research and infrastructures thus version of the envri rm has been updated
to re orientate and align it with òtypicaló data life cycle model the adopted life cycle model illustrated in figure
and table below has been designed in accordance with the main state changes to data being processed by ris7 and
initially documented in deliverable d5 atkinson it has been checked against other published variants of life cycle for research data
that are often cited dataone michener digital curation centre higgins data documentation initiative ddi and found to be compatible as
originally documented in the information viewpoint of version of the rm and based on analysis of the original ris figure

quality of data curation curated annotated qa assessed reviewed mapped additional data created to facilitate identification and retrieval activities designed

processed visualised summarised further annotated activities designed to support advanced processing of data querying summarising visualising modelling among others use
processed used cited referenced data used for creating new data which can undergo further processing and storage activities designed to
derive new data products including information and knowledge the first set of changes required review of the rm and determining
whether pre existing references to òsubsystemsó should all be changed to life cycle phases this included introducing the data life
cycle model as part of the rm overview and editing each viewpoint to change the focus from the definition of
subsystems to supporting the research data life cycle this led to the publication of re vamped version of the rm
in july the following sub sections summarise the principal changes made in version changes to rm overview section the rm
overview has been edited to introduce the data life cycle the changes include adding diagram to explain the life cycle
model and editing the description of how the rm supports systems that process research data following the life cycle model
in the previous version the overview started with the presentation of subsystems in this version subsystems descriptions are replaced by
the description of the phases of the data life cycle the rm has value because of its harmonising role this
is not to say that it harmonises the solutions adopted by ris nor does it harmonise the requirements that ris
express what it does do is to harmonise the context in which we talk about these things so that we
can understand one another and so that we can identify points at which interactions and or integrations between an ri
and either another ri or digital infrastructure for research di4r can take place the relationships between the life cycle phases
are introduced as òintegration pointsó integration points are identified as the main transition boundaries between different phases of the data
life cycle expressed as the possibility to achieve some integration between one ri and another or between one ri and
digital infrastructure for research di4r at these points data from one phase is passed to another phase for further processing
changes to science viewpoint aligning with the data life cycle touched the three main parts of the science viewpoint sv
communities roles and behaviours however changes have been minimal compared to the changes in the other two viewpoints changes to
information viewpoint the changes to the information viewpoint iv derived from aligning with the data life cycle have been significant
re structuring and naming of the sections have been changed to reflect purpose for instance the òdynamic schemataó section has
been changed to òdata evolutionó and the òstatic schemataó section has been renamed as òdata management constraintsó additionally sections have
been rearranged to provide more compact presentation of the iv concepts in addition to this many diagrams have been replaced
with versions that can be created and shared using open source tools for uml modelling changes to computational viewpoint the
computational viewpoint cv is the first part of the model where an approach to description based around the subsystems idea
seems to become more appropriate the existing description has been edited to emphasise that the purpose of subsystems is to
support the different phases of the data life cycle and to prepare for engineering in addition to this the sections
of the cv have been reorganised to differentiate between component configurations that support the data life cycle directly and those
configurations that support infrastructure integration other changes in addition to the changes outlined above this review of the rm also
led to corrections and updates of information for instance sections with duplicated material have been removed and dead or erroneous
links have been corrected updated as needed further considerations around the data life cycle figure and table summarise the phases
of typical life cycle for research data by necessity these are simplified representations of what happens in many real world
scenarios here we present some additional information to be considered further and accounted for in the rm during the curation
phase cataloguing is vital to make data ôfairõ findable accessible interoperable reusable fair catalogues must provide access not only to
the raw data but to frequently computed derivatives so that scientists re use those rather than requesting re computation this
is significant in terms of saving energy and costs and helps with standardisation of interpretations however scientists must be able
to access the raw data when they need to in data publishing there can be policies governing the timing and
nature of publication in respect of embargo periods and the accessibility of data data discovery and retrieval processes must recognise
these and permit for example authorised retrieval based on valid credentials of the researcher making the request or limitations on
direct retrieval of data based on for example its sensitivity and or quantity much processing and use of data can
involve interaction with other curated data and or operational data from wider international global activities and infrastructure agreements consideration must
be given as to how such interactions at the process level are accommodated many of the above and similar considerations
are active topics of discussion in the research infrastructures community and in the research data alliance rda 2016a it is
complex area with many variations and possibilities that still must be further refined towards consensus agreements on best practice continuous
consistency assessments of envri rm the analysis of the consistency of the envri rm has been carried out as continuous
progression guided by two main objectives the first objective of the consistency review is to guarantee that the envri rm
provides coverage for all the functionalities included in the minimal set defined in the rm the second objective is to
verify that the models between the different viewpoints are consistent with each other this section describes the gaps found while
trying to verify the fulfilment of these two objectives by inspection and cross checking and explains the solutions advanced to
bridge those gaps the consistency assessment has covered two phases the assessment carried out during the reorientation with the data
life cycle model version and the assessment during the alignment with new requirements version these phases are presented as follows
data life cycle reorientation consistency assessment the minimal set of functionality which is aligned with the common functions within the
data life cycle should be consistent with the concepts defined in different viewpoints an important guiding principle for identifying key
correspondences came from the 2nd envriweek meeting8 during which it was stablished that òris are autonomous entities interacting with each
other to service scientists needs this suggests that identifying the correspondences that need to be made visible in the pursuit
of interoperability between ris is of great relevance in line with this definition the assessment of the envri rm exposed
six specific consistency issues which needed attention these issues and their resolution are detailed in table zandvoort netherlands may table
initial assessment of viewpoints consistency issue advance towards resolution the sv does not present process view processes would tie together
the definition of behaviours roles and communities without process view it is hard to identify the relationship between roles and
behaviours work in progress the diagrams that present the interaction of actions in the evolution of information objects were redesigned
to better illustrate the alignment with the data life cycle the correspondences between iv activities and sv activities is being
used to derive similar diagrams which include swim lines for assigning behaviours to roles the iv of the envri rm
does not present clear view of the different information objects and relationships between them solution the iv models were redesigned
to illustrate the relationships between information objects types some object types not sufficiently clearly defined concept conceptual model solution the
iv information object definitions were revised and organised to clarify terms specification of investigation may contain specifications of measurements which
in turn can be used to evaluate measurement results but this is not well illustrated leaving the reader to infer
it solution the definitions were left open to allow the ris to define their own constraints with regards of limits
validation and qa the definitions of data information concept knowledge are not clearly specified in the rm the rm uses
these terms interchangeably impeding the understanding of what is meant solution the definition for data information concept knowledge should be
aligned with the needs of different ris to limit ambiguity all references to information or data have been edited as
information objects the definition of architecture should start in the computational viewpoint and then be refined further in the engineering
and technology viewpoints the cv lacks description of the architecture for the distribution of the computation objects solution the presentation
of cv objects was reorganised according to architectural layers to support the design of different configurations for all phases of
the data life cycle viewpoint correspondence assessment the three viewpoints of the envri rm help to model the systems that
support the operation of environmental research infrastructures from three complementary perspectives the high level models of the science viewpoint are
representations of the descriptions of the scientific community that will work with the ri and of their business the data
models of the information viewpoint represent the translation of science viewpoint processes into actions designed to encode those processes and
their results in machine readable formats the model of the computational viewpoint assigns the information actions to different computational units
that will effectively carry out the behaviours and processes defined in the science viewpoint this means that the subsystems processes
actors and related objects that constitute an ri are modelled from three different angles or perspectives as in other areas
of engineering civil mechanical to guarantee that the different models from each viewpoint are consistent and correspond to one another
odp supports the notion of ôviewpoint correspondencesõ correspondences are relationships between an object in one viewpoint and objects in another
viewpoint correspondences can be one to one one to many or many to many consistency across viewpoints is verified by
predefined correspondences between the objects of those viewpoints to facilitate verification the correspondences can be grouped according to the phases
of the research data life cycle this minimises the number of objects that must be considered at any one time
judicious selection of correspondences must be made to signify the main relations whilst avoiding complexity through proliferation even so automation
of consistency verification is essential to avoid human error the following sections describe the key correspondences between the three viewpoints
sv iv iv cv and sv cv including information about gaps between viewpoints sv iv correspondences there are two types
of correspondence between the science viewpoint and the information viewpoint sv roles correspond to iv information objects and sv behaviours
to iv actions the first type of sv iv correspondences oversees the encoding of sv roles into iv information objects
in its current version the envri rm does not include detailed structure for defining entities such as users institutions or
research groups they are considered basic roles that any research infrastructure will have codified somehow in their administrative systems9 the
main information objects modelled thus far are data centric and correspond to the encoding of the products of research in
digital form these include the specification of experiment the details of the measurements the persistent data objects and the catalogues
of metadata associated with those objects nevertheless in the future consideration must be given to adding this support see the
second type of sv iv correspondences maps sv behaviours to iv actions iv actions are applied to iv objects changing
their state and creating new iv objects the correspondences between the sv behaviours and the iv actions during acquisition curation
and publishing are the most consistent ones however the mappings between sv behaviours to iv actions in the processing and
use phases present some gaps for instance the sv behaviours for the data use community cannot presently be mapped to
any specific action of the iv additionally the iv actions such as query data query metadata do data mining and
process data cannot be mapped to existing sv behaviours iv cv correspondences there are two types of correspondences between the
information viewpoint and the computational viewpoint iv information objects correspond to cv objects and iv actions to cv objects functionalities
information viewpoint information objects correspondences to computational viewpoint objects are expressed as iv objects manipulated or stored by specific cv
objects these correspondences are implicit and do not require further analysis the consistency of these correspondences is verified as all
the iv objects can be mapped to at least one cv component that will either store or manipulate that object
information viewpoint actions correspondences to computational viewpoint objects functionalities are expressed as iv actions performed by specific cv objects the
functionalities of cv objects are expressed through their interfaces in this case verifying correspondence looking at interfaces only is difficult
because the interface definitions are mostly oriented towards facilitating the integration of components rather than describing the different ways in
which those components can be used in this case the description of the functionalities of the cv objects should describe
explicitly which functionalities are supported by the components for instance the iv action do data mining could be supported using
combination of cv objects that could include virtual laboratory data broker catalogue service annotation service and data store for example
cerif based ôcurrent research information systemsõ cris such as converis from thomson reuters or the open source dspace tool controller
however none of the interfaces to those components indicate that they could be used for data mining sv cv correspondences
the correspondences between the science viewpoint and the computational viewpoint are defined as transitive sv to cv correspondences transitive sv
to cv correspondences are defined through sv iv correspondences and iv cv correspondences in this case if for instance sv
object corresponds to iv object and if iv object corresponds to cv object then it can be said that sv
object corresponds to cv object in this case the problems gaps detected in the sv iv and iv cv correspondences
will affect directly the sv cv correspondences in addition to this some correspondences seem to bypass the iv for instance
the cv security service can be mapped to the sv behaviours for the data use community which the iv does
not address user behaviour tracking user profile management user working profile management user working work relationship management and user group
work support this is partly due to missing iv elements as mentioned in above it is important for security and
privacy that users especially in role experts are considered part of the rm similarly methods underpinning the definitions of behaviours
in the sv should map directly as interfaces in the cv corrective actions and recommendations for improvements up to this
point we assume that the gaps and mismatches between the different viewpoints are not yet serious problem for the users
of the envri rm users of the envri rm can fill the gaps by adding specific objects required when modelling
specific needs in their domain as they can add additional objects for their domain however the analysis above will be
