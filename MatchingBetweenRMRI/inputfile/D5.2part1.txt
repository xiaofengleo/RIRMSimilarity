used in the future to try to bridge the detected gaps science viewpoint create or redefine behaviours that support the
correspondences to the iv actions query data query metadata do data mining and process data information viewpoint create information objects
and actions that support the data use community behaviours existing and planned working practices computational viewpoint redefine objects so that
their functionalities can be mapped to iv actions and sv behaviours rather than relying solely on the definitions of their
interfaces review the naming and definition of objects so that correspondences are easier to identify for security and privacy purposes
consider what additional elements may be needed in the iv alignment with outputs from research data alliance rda terms from
the data foundations and terminology working group dft wg based on data models presented from different disciplines including from the
former envri project and on interactions with different scientists and scientific departments the data foundations and terminology dft working group
of the research data alliance rda has produced several inter related reports see bibliography page error bookmark not defined in
appendix rda defined several simple definitions for digital data in registered domain based on an agreed conceptualisation the essential output
of the dft group definitions and model is condensed in the document dft core terms and model v1 dft wg
rda where terms and their relationships are defined the terms defined in the envri rm information viewpoint iv are the
closest match to those described by the dft wg appendix page summarises and makes comparison table on page and table
on page of the terms in the iv and the corresponding term in the dft core term definitions dftwg ctd
the compatibility of the rda dft terminology and the envri rm set of iv information objects will facilitate aligning the
envri rm with the work of other rda groups moreover the alignment can support the development of collaboration cross fertilisation
activities between the envri community and the rda interaction with data fabric interest group dfig the rdaõs data fabric interest
group dfig is concerned with identifying set of common components and defining their characteristics and services that can be used
across boundaries in such way that they can be combined to solve variety of data scenarios such as replicating data
in federations developing virtual research environments supporting the exchange of data and so forth10 in late october contact has been
initiated between envriplus project and dfig with the aim of ensuring alignment and compatibility of the work emerging from the
two efforts specifically there is agreement to identify how and whether the envri rm can contribute to addressing the problem
areas being studied in dfig contribution of task embedding the hes approach the hes human environment systems approach is an
integrated approach towards studying the interface and reciprocal interactions that link human sub systems economic social agricultural to natural sub
systems hydrologic atmospheric biological of the planet11 the societal grand challenges identified and studied by wp12 could be modelled within
the community concept of the science viewpoint where one can already can find differentiation according to its objective the application
area could be related to the five life cycle phases data acquisition data curation data publishing data processing data use
or at least this approach could be used as starting point for further modelling in this respect whether it should
be provided as an integral part of the rm or as supplement to it has still to be decided on
the other hand the grand challenges are not yet defined properly and still under discussion it has been decided to
provide detailed model for this part within the rm only after clear acceptance of the concept of grand challenges between
the ris this should be possible during assessing the requirements of the new larger community of environmental ris the envri
rm has been developed originally based on the common functionalities identified across ris chen 2013a chen 2013b assessing the requirements
of the new larger community of ris represented in the envriplus project the reference model has been improved envri rm
version this has involved mapping the outcomes of the requirements collection and analysis task task atkinson into changes that must
be made to the rm the approach used and the main recommendations made are explained in sections and respectively the
detailed analysis recommendations and modifications made are explained for each of the main topic areas in sections ð6 following below
https www rd alliance org group data fabric ig wiki recommendations html https en wikipedia org wiki coupled_human e2 93environment_system
approach for analysing ris requirements the requirements report deliverable d5 atkinson has been reviewed and analysed as follows first requirements
have been collected from the document into spreadsheet each sentence expressing requirement was converted to spreadsheet row each requirement was
mapped to phase of the data life cycle and to one of the functionalities described within the envri rm by
adding tag indicating phase and tag indicating functionality each requirement that was not straightforward mapping received an interpretation and or
keyword which supported mapping and comment about the mapping or what to do with the requirement was added requirements have
been grouped and summarised see appendix page and recommendation on how to proceed after the analysis has been provided see
section recommendations derived from the analysis total of requirements have been derived from deliverable d5 these requirements have been mapped
to the set of functionalities used for building the envri rm the count of requirements mapped to functionalities was used
to prioritise which requirements indicated areas of concern this mapping produced list of the most important functionalities to target during
the update of the envri rm the full list of identified requirements and the mapping to functionalities for selection is
described in appendix the top ten functionalities that map to requirements arising from d5 are listed in table the first
three columns contain the identifier id name and definition12 of the functionalities the fourth column contains the count of requirements
derived from d5 mapped to that functionality these top ten functionalities account for of the requirements table top ten mapped

of the mapped requirements if they cover all aspects then no further action was needed otherwise there are three possibilities
modify the definition ii refine the functionality or iii create new functionality the first option requires the least changes the
second option extends the existing functionality by adding refinements that account for the requirements needs the third option creates new
functionality in the rm maybe even at different level than the one mapped initially this would point to new requirements
not recognised previously from the initial analysis of ris carried out by the forerunner envri project chen 2013a table lists
the recommendations for modifying the rm according to the analysis the following sections 3ð explain in detail how these recommendations
have been derived for each of the top ten functionalities table summary of recommendations for enhancing the rm data identification
correct the model at science and computational viewpoints science viewpoint should accommodate identification within the curation community both in roles
and in behaviours computational viewpoint place this functionality at the use phase move to curation phase specific types of identification
should be included as alternatives in the technology viewpoint specification this should include use of handles doi pid or other
similar and strategies for using file names and other types of identifiers uri data cataloguing catalogue manager could be new
role in the sv the role could be passive role software agent implements it this would correspond directly to the
catalogue service defined in the cv specific types of catalogues could be included as alternatives in the technology viewpoint specification
data product generation create the data process manager the role could be passive role software agent implements it this would
correspond directly to the process controller service defined in the cv new data products are created at all stages of
the data life cycle for instance backup metadata provenance and other such data objects can be seen as data products
in sense the creation of data products is already accounted for in the rm discussion about the pertinence of being
explicit at naming data products would be required but not urgent highly relevant for provenance data publication requirements lack enough
support or relevance to merit modification recommendations data citation follow the model proposed in the computational viewpoint and place this
functionality at the use phase the use phase is where citations are produced to indicate that data has been used
specific services for handling citations may be needed especially for linking citations to provenance and resources semantic harmonisation expand the
minimal model to include semantic harmonisation add role in the sv to deal with harmonisation explicitly make explicit the support
of harmonisation in the iv indicate the support in the definition of mapping rule setup mapping rule and perform mapping

wrongly aligned to scientific workflow processing functionalities given that it is the only one explicitly supporting provenance provenance is wider
as demonstrated in the iv provenance tracking data use requirement users of data are informed about the processes which generated
the data by provenance information provenance should be linked to the use phase generation of provenance data should be linked
to the use phase of the data life cycle the sv should define roles and behaviours supporting provenance tracking the
cv should define specific objects and interfaces which support provenance tracking provenance tracking is not part of the minimal model
should be included in the minimal model data processing control requirements lack enough support or relevance to merit modification recommendations
data use requirements lack enough support or relevance to merit modification recommendations resulting from this analysis the priorities to address
the changes to the rm have been determined to be the following semantic harmonisation not part of the minimal model
provenance tracking closely related to processing control and workflow enactment data cataloguing revise status data identification revise status data citation
revise status data product generation revise status data processing control revise status data use new set of functionalities can be
derived from these requirements data publication revise status data discovery and access revise status the following sections explain the analysis
of the specific sets of requirements and the changes made to the rm to address them in detail semantic harmonisation
analysis and recommendation the requirements mapped to harmonisation point out needs to assure interoperability data sharing linking ris homogenisation collaboration
between ris discovery and reuse enhanced interaction and synchronisation of the different ris twelve indicated these needs in the generic
information section of d5 actris anaee eiscat 3d elixir embrc emso fixo3 iagos interact is enes2 lter seadatanet seadatanet includes
three other ris eurofleets2 jerico and esonet the envri rm version describes semantic harmonisation as òfunctionality that unifies similar data
knowledge models based on the consensus of collaborative domain experts to achieve better data knowledge reuse and semantic interoperabilityó however
semantic harmonisation is not part of the minimal model science viewpoint semantic harmonisation is defined as one of the behaviours
of the data publication community no role is linked expressly to semantic harmonisation in theory any of the actors could
then perform the behaviour information viewpoint no information object or activity is expressly marked as supporting semantic harmonisation however the
definition of the mapping rule object together with the setup mapping rule and perform mapping action indicate support for harmonisation
computational viewpoint the experiment laboratory implements translate request interface which is used when mappings between semantic domains are required experiment
laboratory is used in processed data import and internal data staging the following are the recommendations for enhancement expand the
minimal model to include semantic harmonisation add role in the sv to deal with harmonisation explicitly make explicit the support
of harmonisation in the iv indicate the support in the definition of mapping rule setup mapping rule and perform mapping
make explicit the support of harmonisation in the cv may need specific component to facilitate mapping changes made to implement
recommendations the following changes have been made to implement the above recommendations semantic harmonisation is defined as the functionality that
unifies similar data knowledge models based on the consensus of collaborative domain experts to achieve better data knowledge reuse and
semantic interoperability metadata harvesting is defined as the functionality that regularly collects metadata in agreed formats from different sources in
the science viewpoint one role and two behaviours have been added to the sv to explicitly support semantic harmonisation and
metadata harvesting semantic curator an active role which is person who designs and maintains local and global conceptual models and
uses those models to annotate the data and metadata select or build conceptual model behaviour performed by semantic curator which
supports the annotation of data and metadata data annotation behaviour performed by semantic curator which supports the linking of data
and metadata with conceptual models global and local the activities in the information viewpoint iv already support semantic harmonisation and
metadata harvesting table iv activities that support semantic harmonisation and metadata harvesting iv activity semantic harmonisation metadata harvesting annotate metadata
metadata is linked to local and global conceptual models annotate data data is linked to local and global conceptual models
annotate action create links to local and global conceptual models resolve annotation dereference from local or global conceptual models to
data objects build conceptual models manually build the local and global conceptual models harvesting can support collecting and generating the
models automatically setup mapping rules manually create rules to link data objects to global and local conceptual models harvesting and
pattern matching can be used to create rules automatically iv activity semantic harmonisation metadata harvesting perform mapping mapping can be
automatically performed in the computational viewpoint the data curation and data publishing subsystems have been redefined to include configurations where
the semantic laboratory is used to annotate data and metadata and to align those annotations with local and global models
the semantic broker has been redefined to support harvesting and harmonisation provenance tracking analysis and recommendation in the previous version
of the envri rm provenance was only mentioned in the context of scientific workflow enactment however the requirements for provenance
go beyond supporting scientific workflow enactment in this case the definition could be passed back to workflow enactment or refined
as provenance tracking the envri rm version describes scientific workflow enactment as òspecialisation of workflow enactment supporting the composition and
execution of computational or data manipulation steps in scientific application important processing results should be recorded for provenance purposesó science
viewpoint there are no roles linked directly to support workflow enactment or provenance tracking there are no specific behaviours linked
to support workflow enactment or provenance tracking information viewpoint provenance is mentioned several times the iv defines both an object
and an action that implement provenance tracking computational viewpoint the cv defines coordination and process controller services which in turn
implement interfaces which support workflow execution and monitoring provenance is only mentioned marginally no component designed to support provenance tracking
the following are the recommendations for enhancement these requirements were wrongly aligned to scientific workflow processing functionalities given that it
is the only one explicitly supporting provenance provenance is wider as demonstrated in the iv by wider we mean that
it should be included in all phases of the data life cycle from acquisition to use provenance tracking is data
use requirement human users of data are informed about the processes that generated the data by provenance information software components
may also be informed about provenance and act upon it provenance should be linked to the use phase generation of
provenance data should be linked to the use phase of the data life cycle the sv should define roles and
behaviours supporting provenance tracking the cv should define specific objects and interfaces which support provenance tracking provenance tracking is not
part of the minimal model it should be included in the minimal model changes made to implement recommendations the following
changes have been made to implement the above recommendations the iv presents provenance as an activity that parallels the activities
in the data life cycle registering the outcomes of each phase as important provenance elements the diagrams of the iv
have been redesigned to make clear the points where provenance data can be collected the corresponding roles and behaviours in
the sv still require definition as do the corresponding objects in the cv new functionality needs to be included if
provenance tracking is added as parallel activity to all processes during the data life cycle for provenance reasons all derived
data products must be identified see sections and data cataloguing analysis and recommendation requirements include the description of different types
of functionalities for cataloguing including several types of catalogues of observation systems and laboratory equipment catalogues of physical samples catalogues
of data products and or results catalogues of publications reference catalogues federated catalogues and processing catalogues in addition to this
several characteristics of the catalogues are presented including standardised approach ogc swe ssn iso iec 191xx links for provenance between
publications and datasets automatically supplying the entire set of metadata characterising the task through the provenance framework optimise the management
of provenance data streams preserving the link between data and their provenance metadata the envri rm version describes data cataloguing
as òa functionality that associates data object with one or more metadata objects which contain data descriptionsó science viewpoint in
the data curation community the data curator role is described as being responsible for catalogues no behaviour is proposed to
support data cataloguing specifically information viewpoint metadata catalogue is defined as an information object register metadata is defined as an
information action which enters metadata into catalogue the òregisteredó state is metadata state which indicates that metadata has been added
to metadata catalogue computational viewpoint catalogue service is defined as curation service to support the curation of datasets this service
should provide four interfaces export metadata query data update catalogue and query resource the catalogue service is used in brokered
data export brokered data import brokered data query processed data import and raw data connection the following are the recommendations
for enhancement catalogue manager could be new role in the sv the role could be passive role software agent implements
it this would correspond directly to the catalogue service defined in the cv specific types of catalogues could be included
as alternatives in the technology viewpoint specification changes made to implement recommendations the following changes have been made to implement
the above recommendations passive role has been added to the sv curation community to support cataloguing catalogue system passive role
catalogue system is special type of storage system designed to support building of logical structures for classifying data and metadata
to aid discovery access and use data identification analysis and recommendation requirements refer to the need for identification management functionalities
that include doi management standard homogenous approach to identification identification of dynamic data series identification of results from data queries
data services data identification automation identification of data objects stored as files using file names as identifiers or suitable alternatives
identifier systems used are based on handles dois from datacite epic pids persistent and unique identifiers for both data and
metadata objects and ensure availability of identification services the envri rm version describes data identification as òa functionality that assigns
global unique identifiers to data contentsó science viewpoint pid generator is part of the data publication community while data identification
is linked to data curation possible conflict no behaviour is proposed to support data identification information viewpoint unique identifier uid
is defined as an information object assign unique identifier is defined as an information action there is no state linked
to identification of data or metadata the definition may need state to indicate whether the identifier has been assigned an
object may have more than one identifier associated with it computational viewpoint pid service is defined as an external service
to provide identifiers for data objects and to resolve objects this service should provide two interfaces acquire identifier and resolve
identifier the pid service is linked to the data use phase the pid service is used in brokered data import
processed data import citation and raw data connection the following are the recommendations for enhancement correct the model at science
and computational viewpoints science viewpoint should accommodate identification within the curation community both in roles and in behaviours computational viewpoint
place this functionality at the use phase move it to the curation phase specific types of identification should be included
as alternatives in the technology viewpoint specification this should include use of handles doi pid or other similar and strategies
for using file names and other types of identifiers uri changes made to implement recommendations the following changes have been
made to implement the above recommendations new behaviour and new role have been added to the sv curation community the
pid generator and pid registry roles have been removed from the sv publishing community and combined into single role of
pid generator in the sv curation community pid manager passive role system or service that assigns persistent global unique identifiers
to data and metadata products the manager invokes an external entity the pid service to obtain pids the manager maintains
local catalogue of pids that are being used to reference data and metadata if the data or metadata in the
ri change location or are removed the pid manager updates this information locally and informs the pid service pid generator
passive role public system or service which generates and assigns persistent global unique identifiers pids to sets of digital objects
the pid generator also maintains public registry of pids for digital objects data identification behaviour performed by pid manager which
assigns pid for data and metadata being curated for provenance reasons above all derived data products must be identified this
includes both finalised products and intermediate ones however not all intermediate products are suitable for publishing it is necessary to
keep track of the data products but only those meant to be published require public persistent identifier other data products
intermediate ones may need different type of identifier data citation analysis and recommendation requirements refer to the need for data
citation functionalities including citation management standard homogenous approach to citation data citation automation guarantee unambiguous resolution of citations ensure credit
to curators and generators of derived data products facilitate collection of usage statistics facilitate citation of data subsets coupling identification
with query provenance the envri rm version describes data citation as òa functionality that assigns an accurate consistent and standardised
reference to data object which can be cited in scientific publications and or from other data collectionsó science viewpoint there
is no role defined in the sv to handle citation the data publishing community defines data citation as behaviour performed
by pid generator which is in charge of maintaining reference between data object and identifier possible conflict or inaccuracy here
information viewpoint citation is defined as an information object there is no information action linked to citation there is no
state linked to citation of data or metadata the definition may need state to indicate if the identifier has been
used in the modified version of the rm cite data action is defined consuming provenance data computational viewpoint citation is
mentioned as one of the ways for finding data sets in cv data publishing pid service is defined as an
external service to provide identifiers for data objects and to resolve objects this service should provide two interfaces acquire identifier
and resolve identifier the pid service is linked to the data use phase the pid service is used in brokered
data import processed data import citation and raw data connection this object is strongly related to citation resolution the following
are the recommendations for enhancement follow the model proposed in the computational viewpoint and place this functionality at the use
phase the use phase is where citations are produced to indicate that data has been used specific services for handling
citations may be needed especially for linking citations to provenance and resources changes made to implement recommendations the following changes
have been made to implement the above recommendations the changes for identification described in the section are designed to better
support data citation data citation involves producing reference for data source that can be resolved externally and link to the
data within the ri the pid manager is responsible for ensuring that the links to resources are kept consistent and
informing of changes to the pid generator the ri can provide the template for citation of data apart from this
the citation activity is responsibility of the data user data product generation analysis and recommendation requirements include the description of
different functionalities for data product generation mostly related to standardisation of processes for data products the envri rm version describes
data product generation as òa functionality that processes data against requirement specifications and standardised formats and descriptionsó this would support
the processing of datasets enabling the automated generation of most data products science viewpoint the generation of data products is
part of the definition of the data curation community the data curator role is described as responsible the generation of
data products data product generation is specific behaviour to be performed by the data curator information viewpoint no information object
is linked to data product generation explicitly process data is defined as an information action which has data product generation
as one of its purposes there is no state linked specifically to data product generation in the modified version of
the rm convert data action is defined to allow generation of data products not part of the original rm but
introduced to indicate the possibility of deriving new data products outside of the ri computational viewpoint process controller is defined
as processing service to support the generation of data products this service should provide one interface specifically for delivering data
products deliver dataset the process controller is used to process data import and data staging the following are the recommendations
for enhancement data process manager could be new role in the sv the role could be passive role software agent
implements it this would correspond directly to the process controller service defined in the cv new data products are created
at all stages of the data life cycle for instance backup metadata provenance and other such data objects are data
products in sense the creation of data products is already accounted for in the rm discussion about the pertinence of
defining an explicit list of expected data product types would be helpful but not urgent changes made to implement recommendations
the following changes have been made to implement the above recommendations data product generation is described as the result of
processing and use activities in the iv the data use diagram identifies the production of new data products product generation
is closely related to provenance see and revises all stages at which products are expected to be generated and has
repercussion to all viewpoints data processing control analysis and recommendation the high count of data processing comes mostly from the
optimisation section of d5 however the requirements are not uniform and vary on reach and specificity the specific requirements from
ris are also broadly stated the envri rm version describes data processing control as òfunctionality that initiates the calculation and
manages the outputs to be returned to the clientó the three viewpoints offer several components that support processing at various
levels the following are the recommendations for enhancement distinguish processing control clearly to highlight that the envri rm describes the
mechanisms that support producing new data products changes made to implement recommendations the following changes have been made to implement
the above recommendations the data processing phase in the cv has been redefined to describe how processing control and coordination
interact to produce new data products the diagrams already existed in the original model but have been re described as
integration points data use 1analysis and recommendation data use requirements in general refer to concerns about usability user support configurability
service provision portals and virtual environments functionalities in the envri rm version at use level are mostly linked to authentication
authorisation account management and identification nevertheless the three viewpoints offer several components that support data use at various levels the
following are the recommendations for enhancement highlight the importance of data use in supporting the interaction of different types of
users with the ri during different phases of the data life cycles 2changes made to implement recommendations the following changes
have been made to implement the above recommendations the cv presentation of the data use phase and the associated subsystems
has been redesigned to highlight the importance of human interaction interfaces provided by presentation objects and program interfaces provided by
service objects the three viewpoints have been updated to support data use data publication 1analysis and recommendation the requirements for
data publication cover wide range of subjects that include publication of data standardisation of processes standardisation of formats specialisation for
specific data products retrieval of data and identification the envri rm version describes data publication as òa functionality that provides
clean well annotated anonymity preserving datasets in suitable format and by following specified data publication and sharing policies to make
the datasets publicly accessible or to those who agree to certain conditions of use and to individuals who meet certain
professional criteriaó this would support the publishing of datasets in wide terms the data life cycle the science viewpoint the
information viewpoint and the computational viewpoint all support the publishing of data the following are the recommendations for enhancement no
new publication requirements detected so no modifications are recommended from this set of requirements 2changes made to implement recommendations not
applicable data discovery and access 1analysis and recommendation the requirements mapped to data discovery and access point out to improvements
on discovery related to better search and access the envri rm version describes data discovery and access as òfunctionality that
retrieves requested data from data resource by using suitable search technologyó science viewpoint the data publication community is defined to
support discovery and access to data the viewpoint defines roles and behaviours in line with this definition information viewpoint the
information viewpoint defines objects and actions that support discovery and access computational viewpoint the information viewpoint defines objects and the
interfaces that support discovery and access to data the following are the recommendations for enhancement no new discovery and access
requirements identified so no modifications are recommended from this set of requirements 2changes made to implement recommendations not applicable moving
towards engineering and technology adding engineering ev and technology viewpoints tv to the present three rm viewpoints scientific information computational
provides the envri community with reference architecture specified in engineering and technological terms together the five viewpoints span all that
is needed from science oriented to technology oriented views of what must be built they provide how different ris can
find common basis for interacting together we separate between engineering and technology because different parts of single ri and different
ris can each be built using different technologies and because technologies change over time taking an engineering view provides us
with technology independent understanding of how the overall ri system is constructed architected separating the two aspects assists also with
maintenance and transition planning and when necessary conformance testing complete reference architecture provides the basis against which existing ri designs
can be evaluated it or parts of it can be adopted as starting point and adapted by any ri as
that riõs concrete architecture either as completely new design basis or as target towards which longer term convergence can aim
it helps to comprehend the existing situation in higher level terms and to identify the points at which interoperability between
ris can be achieved care must be taken not to confuse engineering decisions with technology choices13 engineering viewpoint design approach
the engineering viewpoint is concerned with transparently distributing computational objects from cv over nodes either physical and or virtual it
is concerned with the structure of the nodes including structures needed to support data objects from iv and for the
specification of the communicating channels between nodes it is concerned also with supporting non functional requirements relating to performance reliability
load balancing etc in specifying the engineering viewpoint ev in the envri rm the main aim is to control and
constrain the architectural style to be adopted at interaction points between ris to improve the interoperability between ris without the
need of investment in expensive bilateral transformation interworking gateway functionalities the aim is not to control the internal engineering of
individual ris and thus less emphasis will be given to these aspects when specifying the ev the engineering viewpoint can
be presented as set of templates patterns that assist with deploying the objects and methods specified in the information and
computational viewpoints onto the technology platforms15 selected recommended by the technology viewpoint we mentioned in section above the use case
to integrate the dassh archive of marine species and habitat data with the embrc ri dassh data needs to be
made accessible through embrc the constraints for such typical integration include that metadata associated with the dassh archive is specified
according to nationally accepted metadata standard medin and must be transformed to or interworked brokered with the format used by
embrc re use of dassh data by users of embrc should be notified to dassh perhaps as citation counts and
or data downloads and or data views consultations and transactions should be automated as much as possible for example mapping
automatically as data and metadata are exchanged between dassh and embrc well known example of this is the engineering decision
to use database rather than files structure for storing data technology choice is what kind of database to use sql
relational nosql etc and the choice of specific product for an introduction to the engineering and other viewpoints of odp
refer to linington for example infrastructure platforms such as egi fedcloud eudat helixnebula science cloud or purely commercial platforms such
as amazon web services microsoft azure etc we could select third party service from one of the independent infrastructure providers
egi eu eudat to accomplish this integration but each service probably has its own characteristics and modes of use manual
work is needed to set up the integration and it is difficult to change from one provider to another when
for example service level agreements are not met or when better solution comes onto the market we can be more
specific using capabilities of the envri rm to clearly define the exact functionalities needed for integration not only that but
these functionalities can be provided directly by one or both ris in agreement with one another or they can be
outsourced to third party offering service in accordance with the template or pattern then the choice becomes one of decision
based considerations of competing value offerings service level agreements and other non functional aspects rather than on functional aspects in
other words patterns help to harmonise functional capabilities this is illustrated in figure seen from the perspective of data archive
in ria wanting to integrate with and be part of the virtual laboratory of rib to reach wider user base
figure brokered immediate data export from data archive on request from user in virtual laboratory alternatively as illustrated in figure
rib wanting to pull in and archive data such as the data generated in virtual laboratory of ria to enhance
ribõs own value offering figure brokered data import for curation in data archive we see similar pattern in both illustrations
for brokering between the two pieces of infrastructure in the first case figure ria offers brokered data export pattern composed
of three main objects data broker data transfer service and data exporter16 that allows rib to make requests to use
ria data in ribõs virtual laboratories in the second case figure rib deploys brokered data import pattern again with three
objects16 that allows new data produced in virtual labs of ria to be curated and preserved by rib in both
patterns the broker and transfer service are common while the importer and exporter services are likely to be mirrors of
one another the essential aspect of this example is that there is an area of interaction which we name as
an ôinteraction pointõ between two pieces of infrastructure at which specific engineering pattern can be applied to achieve interoperability between
the two parts definition of term interaction point an interaction point is point between two parts of an architectural design
where an engineering pattern can be applied to achieve interoperability between the two parts an interaction point can appear within
single ri between pair of ris or between an ri and third party an engineering pattern can be implemented jointly
by agreement between the two ris offered by one ri to another as service to which the other ri can
bind and exploit offered as third party service17 that one or both ris can bind to and exploit outsourcing in
all three cases physical interfaces which must be specified in technology terms are implied this will usually mean defined exchange
format and specific protocol operating at an interface most likely being presented at this level in terms of an application
programming interface api best practice guidelines to be found in the tv will recommend that such apis are simple uniform
and deterministic with low atomicity they each represent one micro service that does one thing and one thing only in
forming the set of templates or patterns for the engineering viewpoint there are several considerations to keep in mind the
viewpoint should recognise any engineering constraints arising from what the ris are already committed to the need to minimise the
number of objects from the cv that are treated as logically central behave as single instance with consistent state because
that is expensive to maintain the viewpoint should focus on the interaction between ris focus on interoperability patterns should act
as roadmap for convergence around those18 and points of interaction and integration should revolve around interfaces apis and protocols across
interfaces for data exchange for initiating activity for authentication authorisation and accounting aaa for social collaboration etc metadata definitions and
descriptions of assets data tools resources as the exchange format where reliability and elasticity are needed note that the same
effect or end result can be achieved using one of several alternative patterns thus an appropriate choice of pattern will
need to be discussed and agreed to achieve effective interoperation between different ris broker service negotiates query and transfer requests
transfer service moves the data exporter importer service transform data from to structure the ri needs by third party providers
of digital infrastructure for research di4r such as egi eu eudat etc this criterion effectively says that itõs okay to
treat what goes on inside each ri either side of an interaction integration point as ôblack boxõ where it is
expedient to do so the engineering viewpoint subsystems from the engineering viewpoint perspective the envri rm identifies five subsystems the
ev subsystems are based on the notion of data life cycle phases evident from investigations of all existing ris each
subsystem provides set of capabilities via interfaces invoked by the other subsystems in odp an interface is simply an abstraction
of the behaviour of an object that consists of subset of the interactions expected of that object together with the
constraints imposed on their occurrence however ris can decide the coupling and distribution of the subsystems based on their individual
requirements the definition of subsystems will take components from the cv and objects from the iv and arrange them in
different configurations the existence of component in one subsystem does not limit its use to that subsystem but highlights the
relevance of the component in the subsystem concept data acquisition subsystem provides objects destined to collect data from registered sources
to store those data within the infrastructure19 data curation subsystem provides objects that guarantee the preservation and usability of data
within the infrastructure data publishing subsystem provides objects which enable discovery and retrieval of scientific data subject to authorisation data
processing subsystem provides objects for performing variety of data processing tasks data use subsystem also known as community support subsystem
provides objects that support internal and external users of an infrastructure in their interactions with that infrastructure in addition to
clearly identifying the five subsystems supporting the data life cycle the ev will also identify supporting subsystems that provide service
objects to all of them for instance aaa services are required by all subsystems and consequently are candidates to be
in crosscutting subsystem that provides aaa functionalities across all the other subsystems the objects providing provenance functionalities are also required
by all subsystems also making them good candidate to be grouped as part of an orthogonal subsystem with respect to
the five basic subsystems engineering subsystems and their major components can be logically independent however they can be co located
in operational deployments to improve performance or reduce costs interaction points subsystems can be composed in different ways by ris
to support different tasks across the phases of the data life cycle examination of the interactions between subsystems exposes set
of possible interfaces to be derived for each of these interfaces the interaction between the subsystems can be specified in
terms of protocols that define the subsystems behaviour in relation to one another the ev will define set of interoperability
patterns based on the interaction points between ev subsystems as illustrated in figure note also that in many communities there
is also pressing need for ad hoc ingest of bulk data from pioneering projects as well as temporary deployments or
accumulations established by ris operating elsewhere or outside the governance regime these are vital for full coverage for historical data
and for incorporating pioneering work but they are rarely given enough thought today figure potential interaction points between ev subsystems
these interactions can occur between subsystems provided by single ri but they also allow integration of components provided by third
parties there are ten interaction points note that in the illustration of these points in figure points appear at the
same place where point is shown acquisition curation integrate data acquisition objects with data curation objects curation publishing integrate data

ris identification of core competencies the envriplus project has analysed the requirements of twenty environmental research infrastructures atkinson the core
competencies of these ris are aligned to the data life cycle and define the subsystems that each research infrastructure implements
figure shows the alignment of research infrastructures to the subsystem view supporting the data life cycle brokered soa is style
of service oriented architecture in which registry of services the broker acts as the point catalogue where all services within
the scope of the architecture are registered and discoverable by users and other services figure identifying core competencies of envri
plus ris within this view the degree of support of ris for each life cycle phase and the kind of
data products they produce varies for instance several of the marine ris support acquisition curation and publishing of data however
they focus and specialise on different phases of the data life cycle some are more focused on acquisition of raw
data others on collecting and curating data from different sources yet others will collate and process data from different domains
fixo3 eurofleets jerico esonet emso and euroargo are focused on management of acquisition of raw data from different types of
marine observatories fleets and device networks the main competencies of these ris are in the acquisition phase the types of
data products they make available are commonly closer to raw data than to processed or derived data seadatanet focuses on
integrating data from different types of observations into consistent format to provide more complete picture in this case their main
competencies are in the curation and publishing phases the types of data product produced by these ris are more complex
and imply some degree of processing beyond this other ris such as embrc and sios aim to integrate and use
data from multiple disciplines their main competencies are processing and use the engineering viewpoint can be used to support the
integration of ris following the concept of core competencies subsystems and interaction points alignment with existing viewpoints following the odp
model there are three types of engineering viewpoint object basic engineering objects ev beo container objects ev container and channel
objects ev channel ev beo objects map one to one with objects from the cv ev containers are used to
group ev beo and channels are used to connect ev beos across containers in the envri rm the cv objects
are generic and can be used by any subsystem in the ev cv objects can be specialised to better describe
fully working subsystem in practice ris may already have defined their systems and the division between subsystems may not be
obvious in this case the subsystems will be viewed as logical rather than physical grouping of objects and can be
used to help identify practical interfaces for interoperating between subsystems in different ris the different types of ev containers allow
the definition of containers that are physically distributed and containers that are logically distributed subsystems can therefore be tightly coupled
or extremely loose similarly they can also identify parallelism with large shared memory important for cross correlation algorithms on large
data and fast interconnected clustered essential when simulating systems with effects coupling over wide range of different scales those described
by stiff differential equations thus they capture critical domain knowledge about the critical issues in domainõs scientific methods that have
to be òengineered inó the definition of channels will depend on the distribution model selected recommended architectural style and sector
trends the recommended envri rm architectural style is soa which helps in the deployment of multiple subsystems of services aimed
at supporting the research data life cycle tiers within the soa are already defined in the cv of the envri
rm and can be carried over into the ev the engineering viewpoint will refine and specialise cv objects to clearly
describe each subsystem and identify interfaces by which the subsystems can be seamlessly interfaced to form coherent ri or to
support interoperation across ris currently most ris are built using tiered architecture with some limited use of soa as service
clients outside of the env ri domain there are couple of examples of infrastructures as service providers gbif and embl
are the most well known acting as service providers through service apis at the same time most infrastructures are moving
rapidly towards the cloud computing architectural model ris need to become aware of and prepared to take advantage of the
services offered by infrastructures when it is appropriate and cost effective to do so according to industry21 soa is good
model to ease and support the transition to cloud infrastructures the ev of the envri rm will illustrate the pathways
that facilitate moving the ris into soa model and then use this model to provide and connect to cloud based
services the use of brokered soa architecture also aligns the cv and ev of the envri rm with the current
work of the rda data fabric interest group dfig rda 2016b as well as with geoss brokering principles the dfig
envisions digital object cloud figure in this vision end users developers and automated processes access persistently identified and consistently structured
digital objects the objects are securely and redundantly managed in the digital object cloud the digital object cloud is an
overlay that exposes data contained in variety of information storage systems lannom capgemini hp capgemini oracle kress ibm kreger figure
the digital object cloud the rda dfig is considering the role of brokers in this perspective case by case mediation
has been done for many years by the diverse communities the broker approach which is now evolving towards being metadata
driven has been advanced as an alternative to perform mediation in an automatic more effective multi disciplinary one to many
sustainable and re usable way santoro nativi in this context the independent ris appear as the repositories providing access to
the digital object collections envisioned within the digital object cloud figure figure envri ris within the digital object cloud approaching
the technology viewpoint the technology viewpoint tv provides concepts and constructs to specify the exchange formats interface protocols standards hardware
and software products from which ris can be built or by which they can interoperate the tv can also define
tests to verify that such implementations comply with the specification as prescribed by all viewpoints the tv specifies the plans
and processes for selection acquisition and evolution of the system parts during the lifetime of the ri the sv iv
cv and ev provide technology independent models of the ri at different levels of abstraction the challenge of the tv
is to specify the set of technologies and standards to be used in addition to this in the context of
the european open science cloud eosc eosc those implementations must foster the use of shared european infrastructures and facilitate seamless
integration of ris such infrastructures can serve as model for the basic technologies to be considered in line with the
aims of the ris and the identified envri rm competence areas the following sub sections outline the main objects to
be defined in the tv the correspondence of the tv with the other four viewpoints and the relationship of the
tv with the architectural and engineering models main objects of the technology viewpoint the technology viewpoint defines four main concepts
technology objects implementable standards implementation and ixit implementation extra information for testing the technology viewpoint describes the implementation of an
ri in terms of configuration of technology objects technology objects represent the hardware and software components used for the implementation
and the interfaces linking them there are multiple constraints on the selection of the technologies and standards that can be
used for building an ri the envri rm must identify constraints derived from four areas the environmental research area and
its previous investments and culture core competencies of the ri including any commercial constraints from business related to the ri
the coupling and distribution of the subsystems and the use of third party components the targeted environmental research area constraints
determine the standards that can be used some voluntary standards such as those from ogc for describing geospatial information are
common to many research areas while others are specific to specific research areas for instance darwin core is used in
the biodiversity field to register data about species occurrences requirements also arise from regulatory constraints such as those of the
inspire directive inspire many domains are constrained by existing legacy systems often operating on the basis of long established global
agreements and sector specific standards domain specifications of netcdf file content skills and experience with these systems are critical elements
in the operational practices and innovation paths of an ri the definition of core competencies will determine the main components
to be considered in the building of the ri if the planned ri is aiming to support the entire data
life cycle from acquisition to use the number of components to be considered is substantial on the other hand when
only limited subsystem is considered for interoperation with another ri the number of components might be quite small the choices
available for implementing each subsystem can range from design and construction of bespoke systems through use of common off the
shelf parts to the outsourcing or acquisition of components or services from third parties the coupling and distribution of the
subsystems produce set of constraints that dictate the location of subsystem resources these constraints are closely linked to the decisions
made in terms of developing acquiring or outsourcing the use of third party resources generates constraints that affect the selection
of providers in this case the variability can be from acquisition of assets to be maintained by the ri team
to the use of shared resources in cloud environment correspondence with the other four viewpoints the main principle in the
design process from the high level of the sv to the low level of the tv is the proper identification
of the phases or sub parts of the research data life cycle of concern as stated earlier the sv iv
cv and ev provide technology independent models of the ri its parts and interfaces at different levels of abstraction the
selection of components in the tv is guided by those abstract models the grouping of ev beo and the architectural
model provided by the cv affect the selection of components and the criteria to determine that the selected components are
suited for the needs of the ri the definition of cv objects is in turn affected by the sv and
iv models relation of the tv to architectural and engineering models the definition of the ri in the tv must
interact strongly with the cv and ev specification the selection of technologies and standards has consequences that can lead to
breaking some of the cv and ev models specifying the tv starts cyclical process that that can lead to redefinition
of cv and ev models the envri rm will propose the introduction of ôconfiguration pointsõ in the tv to facilitate
this process definition of term configuration point configuration point is point in the ri design architecture at which designer architect
must make decisions between one technology choice or another or between one third party service solution or another configuration points
exist where alternative technological approaches can be chosen for instance the selection cloud based data storage facility for curated data
will require interfaces to be provided for transferring curated data from the ri curation subsystem to the external cloud storage
subsystem the ri should also consider how to provide access to the data when it is published for instance defining
constraints on use access and citation lot more thinking planning and detail is needed before much of the tv can
be specified it needs deep comprehension of the technology options and the ways in which they can be bundled together
in middleware initially therefore the tv will be populated in specific areas where critical community level decisions are needed future
enhancements to the reference model the current version v2 november of the envri rm is in an advanced state to
support the creation of high level models for designing ris parts of ris and the patterns and interfaces between them
to bring about further integration and interoperability moreover when complemented with the definition of ev and tv the envri rm
will also be tool to facilitate the reuse of common patterns and infrastructures the following sub sections describe possible further
enhancements that can increase the usefulness of the envri rm pending issues from t5 requirements analysis several areas where further
attention to the rm will be needed in the future have been identified by the task requirements analysis atkinson and
from project internal discussions decisions these include in no specific order providing support for definition of requirement for provenance and
corresponding support in the rm for provenance tracking components in the sv iv and cv non functional requirements research campaigns
adding support for canonical metadata and user user interactions provenance tracking the sv presents provenance as an activity that parallels
the activities in the data life cycle registering the outcomes of each phase as important provenance elements definition of the
corresponding roles and behaviours in the sv as well as the corresponding objects in the cv is still pending although
objects and related action types are already defined in the iv in addition better understanding of the inter ri data
provenance and trace mechanisms to be supported must be developed this work is presently being carried out in work package
of the envriplus project but is not due to conclude for some months support is likely to be added in
future version of the rm non functional requirements non functional requirements nfr ranging from performance and cost to ease of
use to rights and obligations is an important area that needs to be further addressed table of deliverable d5 presents
summary of nfrs as follows cost funding mentioned by ris long term data preservation mentioned by ris privacy mentioned by
ris and security mentioned by ris nfrs need to be expressed more explicitly because d5 does not clearly identify them
as functional requirements dominated discussion at that time nevertheless in the future the envri rm needs to consider the nfr
to be supported and how ultimately nfrs must be expressed in formal syntax with declared semantics so that they are
machine actionable can be taken into account when deployment choices across platforms are made research campaigns some ris are built
to serve research campaign many are used by research campaigns and some will initiate research campaigns to improve their effectiveness
or efficiency we define ôresearch campaignõ as co ordinated resourced and sustained effort to achieve recognisable research goal research campaigns
can be conducted both within single organisation or of more interest from the ris and rm perspective can involve multiple
organisations they can encourage independent rival teams to validate results as in the pursuit of the higgs boson more details
and examples may be found in appendix page by considering research campaigns ris and the rm will analyse and consider
topics that have and need long term stability thereby increasing the chances of sustained value for ris the rm and
the recognised commonalities incorporating explicit support into the rm would be helpful as these are processes important to individuals teams
and projects with extended duration multiple participants and research data cycles appendix provides an initial account of the critical features
of research campaign and suggests an approach to their accommodation in the rm the terms in appendix that are in
italics should be considered as candidates for inclusion in the rm consultation with ris and with those leading research campaigns
will be needed to refine this initial view of research campaigns using the rm as framework once the critical concepts
of research campaign have stabilised many of these will relate well to existing concepts in the sv and iv of
the rm some extensions will be necessary for those viewpoints the impact on other viewpoints is expected to be small
adding support for canonical metadata an envriplus project decision zandvoort may has been taken to use canonical core metadata model
as logical point of interoperability between ris there has been proposal presently being documented in deliverable d5 to base this
on the cerif metadata standard for research information cerif this canonical metadata model approach must be further assessed from the
perspective of how to embed support for it into the envri rm user user interaction key aspect of research is
intercommunication between researchers while they work on datasets analysis tools experiments etc the formal channels are publication and citation but
increasingly there is rapid and fluid user user communication arising from the use of electronic communications including social media this
should perhaps be supported requirements in this area are inferred but not explicitly mentioned in deliverable d5 atkinson although they
are known to be identified elsewhere in recent and current virtual research environment projects other potential enhancements scientific workflows the
requirement to support integration of scientific workflows within the ri ict systems has been identified as part of the minimal
model from the first version of the envri rm however the coverage of scientific workflow support has not been adequately
addressed so far in the rm useful recent survey on this topic is liew several further enhancements to the sv
iv and cv are proposed add workflow management system role to the data processing community in the science viewpoint as
well as the behaviours associated with workflow management composition validation optimisation and execution add workflow information object to the information
viewpoint as well as the corresponding actions to support the activities described in the sv add workflow management system computation
object in the computational viewpoint that will correspond to the workflow management system role of the iv and act on
the workflow information objects of the iv similarly the definition of ev and tv will include the integration of workflow
management systems within the processing subsystems data management plan funding bodies increasingly require grant holders to develop and implement data
management plans dmps dcc plans typically state what data will be created and how and outline the plans for sharing
and preservation noting what is appropriate given the nature of the data and any restrictions that may need to be
applied some ris representatives have expressed the view that it would be helpful when the envri rm provides clear support
for representing dmps and the requirements specified in them deliverable d5 òa development plan for common operations and cross cutting
services based on network of data managers and developersó inclusion of support of dmps in the rm must be considered
carefully because support will be required at multiple levels at the overall ri level and at the level of individual
projects that make use of the ri for instance an overarching dmp can be applied to an ri in its
entirety in this it plays roles both in the overall definition of the ri in the first place and ii
during the daily operation of the ri in the first role the ri must define dmp that is policy that
will apply to all the processes for acquiring curating publishing and using data the dmp can be defined as control
constraining policy in the sv and iv that ensures that the acquired data meets precise standards such as data definition
and data integrity constraints the control process should also ensure that data will be processed stored and identified within the
ri infrastructure following concrete procedure the control process will also determine and enforce the access constraints for the data including
guarantees on availability consistency and secure transport finally the control process will define clearly duration of the data in the
system and the related disposal procedures this type of control process can define as an additional crosscutting process which needs
to be implemented for example using the provenance subsystem in the second role the dmp control process is monitored using
the provenance system this can help in facilitating the verification of compliance with the dmp during the operation of the
ri the integration and clear identification of the dmp control process can be extended to help users of the ri
in defining the support of their independent project level dmps for example an ri can define dmp in line with
activities of the data life cycle and define data states to be stored in the provenance records that later can
be used for verifying compliance bulk data ingest autonomous studies perhaps running over many years will themselves have acquired data
internally and administered many of the data management functions associated with the typical data life cycle or similar as depicted
in figure and table page above bulk ingest of such data into ri can occur in any life cycle phase
according to its state at the time this is not currently precluded by the rm and the rm could be
enhanced to cover this case more explicitly this is motivated by the observation that in todayõs system such bulk ingest
is rare and so practitioners must develop their own methods and infrastructure on each occasion they combine such data with
production data steps into practice putting the rm to work the principal target audience for the rm is the ict
experts within ris who have responsibility for the architectural design and implementation of their ri and for its interoperations with
other ris these persons are typically systems architects designers integrators and engineers secondary audiences include research leaders steering the long
term balance of investment in each ri who will appreciate the savings from shared solutions and the benefits of inter
operation and ii third party solution or component providers wanting to understand how to shape their offerings to gain adoption
the biggest challenge is in convincing the target audience of the value of the rm approach how it can help
them and persuading them to invest their time to learn and exploit it this can be made easier when the
learning route delivers easy to achieve and early benefits patterns guidelines for use training materials learning ramps case studies engineering
tooling are all instruments to facilitate this process nevertheless making the complexity of the rm accessible and demonstrating its value
at both theme expert level within envriplus project and at the technical practice level in ris is significant challenge putting
the rm to work in practice requires several continuing steps that include preparing training learning content now that version v2
of the rm is published and stable further effort will be expended envriplus task during the first half of to
develop usable training learning materials and to run webinar series of education activities directed towards the ris raising awareness substantial
progress has been made with raising overall awareness about the rm the rm has existed for several years already firstly
in the envri project and now developed further in envriplus feedback suggests good level of interest and enthusiasm for the
concept from senior ris managements nevertheless the level of awareness and engagement at lower levels in ris organisations is much
less demonstrating the added value of the rm as noted above in section the envri rm presents unified view of
the ri ict system as coherent whole supporting the aims of the research community it addresses the major types of
information and communications technology ict and data oriented operations that given ri is likely to need to support encouraging adoption
and use within several ris eiscat 3d embrc emsodev eufar icos lter level of awareness exists and several have forayed
to exploit the rm for their own design work perhaps the most successful of these thus far have been emsodev
and icos although this has been difficult to assess translation into everyday working practice remains challenging creating community of practice
the community of people familiar with the rm is small at present growing the community of non specialists users will
reduce the barriers to wider adoption of the rm as larger cohort of individuals mutually helping one another emerges initiatives
are needed to stimulate the development of this self supporting community of practice in the longer term the groups supporting
rm use and the system they establish to steer future developments needs to reach critical mass initiated by envriplus but
independent from it so that the contribution of the rm to ri development and operations is sustained appendix page contains
synopsis of ideas gathered during the third envriweek project meeting that took place in prague 18th november these ideas can
be used as basis for making further progress during this will include outlining key messages to disseminate to the wider
envri community outlook and next steps the environmental research infrastructures strategy for aims towards seamless holistic understanding of the earth
system through an approach that enhances technological cultural and human capital eris investments in each of these areas are needed
to integrate instrumentation and icts to òbring about interoperability between regions and between disciplines this is crucial for systems level
science to accomplish it òsteps towards common standards are needed such as agreeing on joint reference model to describe infrastructure
components the work reported in the present document is substantial step towards achieving these objectives which must now find its
way into the everyday parlance of the ris the envri rm has been derived from distillation of the functions seen
today in typical ris and from the notion that life cycle for research data exists and consists of multiple phases
much of the everyday work of practitioners perhaps as much as is concerned with discovering accessing retrieving checking cleaning adjusting
transforming data for the intended purpose of experimental analysis to this extent the rm formalises the elements of the methods
that underpin current and intended working practices of the practitioners during such life cycle and in using the resulting data
the science dynamics an ri has or is trying to support this must continue to be major driver in the
next generation of the rm it can potentially be achieved via representations of the abstract workflows that implement the methods
and the intent of processes the culture training and experience that has domain value which must be sustained preserved and
enhanced wherever possible several important areas see section regarding support for provenance tracking non functional requirements research campaigns hes canonical
metadata scientific workflows data management plans etc imply substantial amount of new content for future iterations of the rm it
still must be decided how best to accommodate such extensions which expand the scope of the rm beyond the minimal
model it set out to establish of the listed areas support for data management plans is the most valuable and
beneficial area to address in the short term references atkinson atkinson hardisty filgueira alexandru vermeulen jeffery loubrieu candela magagna martin
