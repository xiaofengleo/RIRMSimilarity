and earth system research infrastructures projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create more coherent interdisciplinary and interoperable
cluster of environmental research infrastructures across europe it is driven by three overarching goals promoting cross fertilization between infrastructures implementing
innovative concepts and devices across ris and facilitating research and innovation in the field of environment for an increasing number
of users outside the ris envriplus aligns its activities to core strategic plan where sharing multi disciplinary expertise will be
most effective the project aims to improve earth observation monitoring systems and strategies including actions to improve harmonization and innovation
and generate common solutions for many shared information technology and data related challenges it also seeks to harmonize policies for
access and provide strategies for knowledge transfer amongst ris envriplus develops guidelines to enhance transdisciplinary use of data and data
products supported by applied use cases involving ris from different domains the project coordinates actions to improve communication and cooperation
addressing environmental ris at all levels from management to end users implementing ri staff exchange programs generating material for ri
personnel and proposing common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating the socio economic impacts envriplus
is expected to facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single ris and at the pan ri
level it promotes efficient and multi disciplinary research offering new opportunities to users new tools to ri managers and new
communication strategies for environmental ri communities the resulting solutions services and other project outcomes are made available to all environmental
ri initiatives thus contributing to the development of coherent european ri ecosystem table of contents abstract document amendment procedure terminology

an interoperable catalog system aims at organizing the maintenance and access to descriptions of resources and outcomes datasets equipment persons
of multiple ris in framework which implements number of functions on these descriptions the system hence must provide to users
function for seamless discovery of the resource descriptions of the ris encoded using standardized metadata the multi ris context of
envriplus implies that in addition to the descriptions usually provided within each ri resources may also have to be described
at higher granularity it must as well support the data curation activities and guarantee the long term preservation of the
data collected in ri for example by enabling identification of datasets stored in obsolete format at last the catalog should
document the quality of each ri products by managing the provenance and lineages of the resources from the sensor calibration
event or laboratory sampling procedure to the scientific papers one should be able to eventually answer the question does the
data result which led to the conclusion of this paper come from properly calibrated sensors the technical proposal described in
the current document is elaborated from two major drivers theme framework established in wp5 reference model guided ri design short
term challenges for envriplus catalog system and partnership in task8 with assets and expertise provided by the ri and ict
partners theme provides foundation for the current activity as follow deliverable consistent characterisation of existing and planned ris is useful
to analyse assets and requirements of the environmental ri in the catalog scope the document also provides technical review in
this field deliverable development plan for common operations and cross cutting services based on network of data managers and developers
provides framework for the technical architecture where the catalog system is embedded at last the reference model developed in envri
and improved in envriplus contributes to control and validate the completeness of the catalog functions in the science data life
cycle besides in the context of envriplus with bounded time scale and resources the strengths and assets of environmental ri
and ict partners involved in task and the short term challenges identified for the catalog system also drive our work
especially the short term challenge for the catalog system in envriplus is to be proven useful and relevant by the
ris for handling faithful descriptions of their ri own resources datasets equipment this is especially critical because the contribution and
expertise of each ri is required to populate the catalogs with their descriptions at the expected quality and completeness level
at last complementary and usefulness of the catalogs for the use cases developed in wp9 need to be considered although
the diversity and poor maturity in this field is challenging users and functional requirements users from the deliverable analysis the
users targeted for the envriplus catalog systems are users outside the ri research data science ris are keen to benefit
from envriplus to make their products datasets experiment infrastructures useful beyond their traditional targeted users in their community the development
of data science raises new transdisciplinary use cases for the ri datasets how do mosquito born diseases emerge and what
are trends use case developed in wp9 service validation and deployment is one good example of trans disciplinary research supported
by envriplus users inside the ri data managers coordinators and operators pre existing ris have developed expertise and assets to
manage their own resources envriplus benefits from these pre existing features and the envriplus development need to nicely complement the
ri assets and preserve the stable procedures run by the ri operators in their field of expertise besides the ri
depending on their status have mentioned number of functions they would like to develop or improve together in envriplus the
envriplus catalog system should contribute to some of them data curation and citation provenance and standardization of registries of equipment
the stakeholders decision makers and funders of the ri need also to have broad picture of the ri resources in
the european landscape to control their efficiency and complementarity besides from the task partnership and subscription of additional ri in
the ic_8 catalog curation provenance use case promoted by wp9 service validation and deployment the following ri have been targeted
as first priority to have their resources described in envriplus catalog system each has its own pre existing catalog and

overview from description of work and analysis provided by d5 the catalogs are required to support the following functions publication
of metadata to enable discovery of the resources descriptions provided services datasets sensors persons software documentation support curation of resources
dataset software sensors by enabling their maintenance usage scheduling and preservation support science activities by registering usage and processing of
the resources by citing and qualifying the results with provenance or implementing solution other specific use cases the resources which
are considered for cataloguing are environment research infrastructure specific items integrated data service collections synthesis and individual datasets single observation
time series image acquisition services and systems devices sensors equipped sites networks feature of interest processes software workflow web services
physical samples generic items activities observation processing usages contacts persons teams organizations reference terms definitions thesauri documents publication procedures figure
concepts described in catalogs links between them black and with generic reference concepts grey any resource described in the catalogs
as basis metadata element should fulfil number of general requirements creation update curation publication which are detailed in section these
recommendations should be used as general guidelines for research infrastructure to provide catalogs which will be suitable for the use
case developed in wp9 provenance sensor registry virtual research environments and for the discoverability of envriplus resources then depending on
the concept described in catalogs see figure some specific requirements should be fulfilled however the detailed resource descriptions datasets sensors
samples in each ri is too complex sometimes specific or not mature enough the science or operations expectations at cross
disciplinary level are not better defined yet this situation prevents us from attempting to provide comprehensive specification for each detailed
catalog within envriplus project however strategy for the developing cross disciplinary solutions and ensuring the most efficient outcome for envriplus
catalogs implementation is provided at section general requirements for catalogs and metadata the metadata management should fulfil the following requirements
they are classified into categories create and update metadata curate metadata publish metadata this section is intended to converge with
the metadata object recommendation given in the reference model information viewpoint when refined create and update the metadata expertise closeness
the person team or system in charge of the resources should create or update its description temporal closeness the creation
or update of the resources description should be done at the best appropriate time regarding the actual activity described it
is for example counter productive to edit the description of sensor deployment when the dataset is archived in long term
data centre after scientific paper publication years after the observation has been done as consequence it is useful to re
use content from resource management information systems for example sensor maintenance database operation logger on field to automatically feed the
catalogs curation of the metadata in distributed environment the information and specifically the catalog contents will be replicated in various
repositories to properly preserve the information while allowing free and flexible access and use of it few simple rules should
be applied two types of repositories with different sustainability mode can be considered application information systems for acquisition processing or
publication long term archive the application acquisition processing or publication information system sustainability is related to the sustainability of the
application system infrastructure for example the observatory for example the envriplus flagship service catalog has the same sustainability as the
envriplus project years virtual research environment should be also considered as an application information system the long term archive provides
support for forever sustainability of the information the workflow for the metadata should comply with figure figure catalogs repositories interacting
with each other as written in the metadata should be created as close as possible in time and expertise to
the described resource or activity sensors processing permanent identification the identification scheme used by information system creating new metadata should
provide unicity in distributed environment where different operator assign identifier for same type of resources uuid pid the primary identification
scheme should comply with long term sustainability requirements for the resource description the same unique identifier should be kept as
label on its description from the creation of the description across the different repository were the description is replicated this
is mandatory for proper duplicate management additional secondary identifiers might be added to the description during the replication replication for
optimal sustainability the metadata should be replicated with as less brokering or translation as possible to avoid risk associated with
brokering by non expert of the resource the metadata should be replicated to enable good availability of the information at
every time scale within the application sustainability period or for long term cross links for dedicated repositories within same sustainability
scale within one sustainability time scale acquisition system processing or long term links or external references can be used to
cross different repository of catalog with different scopes sensors datasets example ri euro argo argo has catalog of profiling float
platform each should be identified with unique identifier for sensing devices pid or uuid to be defined in wp6 so
that when the platform metadata is replicated in processing and publication systems copernicus mems emodnet or long term archive seadatanet
the identifier is kept for traceability and duplicate management in wider scope publication machine and human interfaces the catalogs should
be discoverable filter list in machine and human interfaces user friendly and shareable the human interface should be user friendly
and resources should be reachable with shared url search engine friendly the user friendly resource description page should be indexable
by general public search engines community and content agnostic standards the machine interface should implement community standards for the resources
described in the catalog the machine interface one content agnostic protocol and format auto descriptive generic for every type of
resource should be provided this will allow semantic linking between different concepts in managed in different catalogs actionable descriptions the
resource description should be actionable by providing references to linked resources or services enabling the user or applications to actually
access the described resource for example visualization or download access from dataset description requirements for item specific catalogs data services
acquisition services physical samples strategy for envriplus catalogs development among the concepts described in the catalogs we can consider the
individual resources datasets persons processes and the resources aggregated into services data and acquisition the ri data services observation collections
synthesis and acquisition services integrated observatories observation networks need to be shown in synthetic catalog which will display and promote
beyond their traditional communities the high quality services provided by ri besides the individual resources descriptions need compliant to recommended
standards which should be harmonized across research infrastructures so that transdisciplinary discovery curation and provenance tools or technology driven demonstrations
theme catalog of solutions are applicable across the cluster of ris thus two main targets are identified for the envriplus
catalog system they both participate in complementary top down and bottom up approaches top down this approach aims at showcasing
the outcome of the ri so that they reach new inter disciplinary and data science usages the homogeneous and qualified
descriptions provided in single seamless framework will also be tool for stakeholder and decision makers to oversee and evaluate the
outcome and complementarity of ri data products the top down approaches can be compared in news business to traditional newspapers
where an editorial policy selects the news to meet public expectation with certain amount of accepted subjectivity figure traditional newspaper
with top down manned editorial policy the task8 will design and develop flagship data and acquisition service catalog which will
provide this top down view and entry point for hierarchical discovery of the envriplus ri resources this development will support
use case ic_8 catalogs in wp9 bottom up this approach will provide fine grained catalogs which will facilitate the deployment
of the theme solutions for example for provenance management throughout the interested ri this can also enable fine grained discovery
and development of trans disciplinary applications to browse resources across the ri the detailed resources description datasets sensors samples in
each ri is too complex and sometimes specific to expect comprehensive specification for each within envriplus project the capabilities of
aggregating applications will also be challenged to provide relevant results out of these heterogeneous inputs the bottom up approach can
be compared in news business to social media where automated algorithms aggregate the news to meet individual expectations with certain
amount of accepted heterogeneity in results verified and un verified news advertisements figure facebook wall where inputs are aggregated by
algorithms depending on personnal configuration of the user however in the short term the fine grained catalogs are useful and
can be used as back end for software solutions proposed in theme see use cases in wp9 for example tc_4
sensor registry the specific fine grained catalogs will then be designed and developed depending on the use cases besides the
general requirements given see the current document will not give further requirements on fine grained catalogs actually maximum flexibility and
reactivity in the development of these catalogs is wished to fulfil the requirement of the different use cases nevertheless for
resources such as contacts documents and keywords which are useful to describe the flagship resources some requirements are given in
section figure strategy for envriplus catalog development flagship data and acquisition service catalog data services the maturity of ri for
the management of their data services in catalog the good level of standardization in this field iso19xxx series dublin core
and availability of homogeneous technical solutions partially adopted in ri geonetwork ckan cerif enables to target an integrated service for
flagship data product discovery by the end of the envriplus project to streamline the implementation of the data product catalog
it is chosen to concentrate on so called flagship data services which are the datasets the ris want to first
communicate on examples of flagship data services are historical data collection of quality assessed water column temperature and salinity in
mediterranean sea for seadatanet and argo profiling float observations general data assembly portal for euro argo acquisition services however most
of ri outcome is not only datasets but services on top of platforms infrastructures or sites organized in networks these
well maintained infrastructures are organized to host experiments for scientists sometimes called principal investigators pi for example anaee provides set
of experimental equipment from ecotrons to in natura sites where researchers can carry out experiments and collect results argo provides
fully integrated network of ocean drifting and profiling platforms with data management researchers focused on ocean properties or location can
benefit from this infrastructure for deployment operations and data management to complement the exposition of data services in the catalog
the publication of description of acquisition services is required as the current level of maturity and adoption of standards regarding
the management of infrastructure descriptions is not as good as for datasets yet this task is being considered in second
priority note that the flagship data and acquisition services will complement with science and engineering view point the synthetic ri
description already provided in the esfri roadmap with management and organizational view point see figure figure esfri synthetic ri catalog
with anaee fact sheet1 detailed function requirements are given in the following sections envriplus flagship data and acquisition service catalog
flagship data service catalog introduction the section aims at defining the requirements for the description repository of envriplus ri flagship
data products example of products are historical data collection of quality assessed water column temperature and salinity in mediterranean sea
data service seadatanet argo profiling float observations general data assembly portal data service euro argo the granularity of data product
considered here is coarse to balance ri visibility each should provide to data products the datasets described in this catalog
must have reached the published status as defined by the reference model the functions provided by the repository are enable
discovery of resources in english interface multilingualism is not supported in the initial version enable curation by providing information regarding
the preservation of the data storage format host provenance of the dataset should also be covered however the task which
defines the requirements for provenance had not started when the document is written evaluation of descriptions will be useful for
ri to evaluate the quality of their contributions missing fields broken reference links this will as well help external users
to quickly evaluate the result they got from their catalog request the following sections define for the flagship data product
catalog the detailed product description required for discovery and curation the evaluation of description function the request criteria capabilities data
service description the product description content the fields or attributes is defined here after external references for vocabularies and contacts
are required guidelines for these reference information are given in the requirements on product description are defined by adopting the
rda metadata interest group https rd alliance org groups metadata ig html this list is kept simple on purpose for
this initial version of the catalog we need to quickly achieve consensus between ris which prevent us from considering sometimes
important details for example depth or altitude coverage when necessary they are adapted for the envriplus context ri the research
infrastructure responsible for the current data product for example icos id uri for the current data product resolving to landing
page ideally doi digital object identifier for example http dx doi org a61129f0 afbc 4bfa 00f37d37d98a title title in english
for the data product the ruled advised by w3c for good title in html page can be applied https www
w3 org qa tips good titles html it especially helps to show well the results in search engine for example
north atlantic ocean temperature and salinity observation collection v2 abstract description of the current product with no layout directive except
carriage return quicklook added to rda recommendation for user friendliness of the catalog url to an image illustrating the current
data product the image should be fit be shown in thumbnail version with height and width dimensions in between and
pixels keywords free keyword or keyword with definition provided in vocabulary service as an uri as recommended in section keywords
might encode wide range of information research sites typology of data products raw observation spatio temporal synthesis temporal resolution single
measurement hourly daily spatial sampling geometry single point transect sampling horizontal observed properties temperature pressure feature of interest atmosphere sea
water biota status nominal obsolete superseded temporal window period during which the data is applicable for when the data service
is continuously updated with new observation data the 爀nd boundary is left blank encoding is iso8601 for example start date
end date geo spatial bounding box in wgs84 westernmost and easternmost longitude or for coverage cross meridian and southernmost and
northern most latitude where the data is applicable for example westernmost longitude easternmost longitude southernmost latitude northernmost latitude although not
strictly required for cost effectiveness purpose more flexible encoding of the spatial coverage of the dataset will much better represent
the actual fitness of the dataset the various geometries of the dataset single point multi point poly line trajectory or
polygon are indeed loosely synthetized as bounding box geojson or gml encoding provide this flexibility and are supported by ckan
as much as possible this feature will be implemented the vertical coverage is also very important to document data services
however the various coordinate reference systems in this field makes it challenging to manage numerically at transdisciplinary level the keywords
and especially feature of interest water column sea bed or land surface solid earth atmosphere see erreur source du renvoi
introuvable might be an interesting alternative to document the vertical coverage of data services location url where the data product
is curated generally landing page format format as the product datasets is curated the format should be listed in the
mime type reference list either as standardized by iana http www iana org assignments media types media types xhtml or
shared by community application netcdf for example application netcdf contacts contacts relevant for the current resource the contacts have roles
and identifiers as pid the uri of the pid must comply with recommendation in section the roles for data products
are as defined in iso19115 among for example originator related documents or resources related documentation user manual quality report scientific
paper should be listed with doi and free text short description other resources such as web services web api data
visualization or sub setting portal should be listed with url and free text short description for example http archimer ifremer
fr doc pdf availability licence terms of use of the data product are described in document or licence which can
be generic creative commons or specific in both cases the document is cited through canonical and stable url the commitment
of the ri or infrastructure to maintain the availability of the data service should be described in the term of
use documentation this can be done as service level agreement as recommended in itil iso20000 for operational it services in
later version of the envriplus information system with connexion to aai implementation the list of users having accepted or obtained
license will need to be registered in licence catalog or in the aai for example http creativecommons org licenses by
or http www seadatanet org data access license status and update date added to rda recommendation so to enable sorting
with latest update the date when the specification of the data product has been updated note that if product is
data service which data is continuously updated in real time the update date is not the date of the latest
data submission but the date of the specification update for the data flow new parameter new quality control for provenance
purpose every dataset published and once should be kept available as well as its description in the catalog therefore together
with the update status managed in keyword should describe if the data product is obsolete or superseded comment in the
abstract can give details on superseding products and motivation the date must be encoded in iso8601 for example 08t12 evaluation
function the evaluation function aims at measuring the quality of the description metadata unlike traditional checkers which give yes no
status or number of errors or warning on the metadata record the objective is to continuously quantify the quality of
the description encoded in the metadata record this evaluation will introduce some flexibility in the metadata ingestion process of the
catalogs any record can be considered and ingested if they meet the standard encoding iso19xxxx dublin core the measurement of
the quality of the record then is useful in to perspective the external users will be able to sort their
request results according to the quality of the records as actually google does for web pages the metadata record provider
will be encouraged to improve the quality of his her contributions the proposed evaluation criteria are completeness of the description
regarding the attributes expected specific threshold can be considered in the quality of the record with the following statuses data
curated visualization service available direct data access available data cited accuracy of the description the usage of external references as
valid resolvable url should increase the value of completed attribute the evaluation function will need to be proof tested against
real metadata records and validated afterward figure example of metadata evaluation done in us noaa data centres request criteria for
the first version simple request criteria should be supported spatio temporal criteria keyword or full text update date criteria for
latest updates the request only apply to metadata and not on the data content observed quantities or observed objects flagship
acquisition services catalog although the maturity level for managing acquisition service catalog homogeneously at cross disciplinary level is not as
good as for data services some requirements can be described flagship acquisition services catalog is useful for ris to communicate
on their services beyond their traditional research community some ri are indeed not designed for providing an integrated data service
but rather high quality logistics and support to host research experiment on equipped sites to communicate on these capabilities some
ri are already providing acquisition services description services in catalogs see figure figure metatron acquisition service from anaee ri the
acquisition service description should contain the following attributes ri identifier title abstract quicklook keywords location contacts related document resources reference
catalogs recommendation for use in two specific cases for dedicated attributes values are references to external catalogs the following sections
give recommendations for usage of controlled vocabularies enumeration for classification see section for citation of persons teams of organizations see
section controlled vocabularies enumerations keywords should be encoded as label and as much as possible as links uri to well
maintained stable references the systems curating these references must manage deprecate and supersede operations of the terms without threatening the
permanence of the references these keywords can be linked to full ontologies linking concepts together but simple list of well
defined terms are also acceptable the reference system should provide multilingual labels and definitions the system should also support content
negotiation so to show human or machine readable interfaces depending on the requesting client the content negotiation principles are detailed

the overall targeted architecture is described in deliverable d5 development plan for common operations and cross cutting services based on
network of data managers and developers the catalog architecture will fit in this overall architecture the catalog system is itself
actually distributed in the all the components of this overall targeted architecture ri mantain their dedicated catalogs on their infrastructure
especially the descriptions metadata of the data and acquisition services provided by the ri are maintained where the expertise is
the catalog update operation defined by the envriplus reference model is done by operators on these catalogs which structure best
fit the ri discipline specificities reference information can be managed on shared infrastructure such as documents registered on openaire or
persons on orcid at last to consolidate the information here metadata elaborated in ri superset catalogs replicate and gather information
from the ris it is recommended to allow flexibility and redundancy in the superset catalogs to adapt the maturing cross
disciplinary solutions developed in wp9 use cases regarding the catalogs specifically the proposed architecture is as follow figure catalogs architecture
envriplus superset catalogs contain the standardized metadata records of the ri resources standard discovery functions are provided on top of
these superset catalogs multiple instances of catalogs can be implemented each have their strength and specific focus ri dedicated catalogs
contains the ad hoc metadata representation of ri resources in their field of expertise update and advanced discovery or reporting
functions are provided on top of these catalogs they are used by ri operators and their content is partially harvested
in the superset catalog from standard interfaces reference catalogs contains information not specific to environmental ri but implemented by dedicated
european or global infrastructures the reference catalogs should be used under some constraints see identification schemes or services following wp6
recommendation should be used to identify records in catalogs the reference ri and superset catalogs should be discoverable in rdf
through sparql end points specifically for the flagship data and acquisition services catalog additional implementations details are given here after
for the other catalogs the details on possible implementation will be given and demonstrated in the use case development in
wp9 flagship data service catalog architecture cerif and eudat b2find are candidates for being superset catalogs for the envriplus flagship
data products catalog they both have their specific strengths cerif implements data model which scope encompass different aspects of sciences
funding infrastructures datasets this is for envriplus an opportunity to collect in single repository the information related to ri and
therefore ease discovery and reporting on those in addition cerif is interoperable with range of metadata standards iso19xxx dublin core
dcat and oil reference model eudat b2find is ckan server dedicated to dataset discovery it is up and running and
provides low threshold solution to initiate the flagship data product catalog it can harvest iso19xxx and dublin core records figure
cerif data model figure eudat b2find discovery interface for first version these superset catalogs will collect metadata records from the
following first circle of ri catalogs anaee euro argo embrc epos iagos icos lter seadatanet the record collection will be
implemented by so called harvesting process the ri catalog content will be exposed in standard interfaces implementing canonical metadata profiles
defined in iso19139 dc dcat the superset catalog will periodically extract latest version of metadata from these interfaces to consolidate
them in their repository the description evaluation function is meant to be simple and will be implemented by both catalogs
the envriplus cerif implementation will be set up and operated by epos the ckan implementation is configured and operated by
dkrz as b2find function of eudat summary the current document provides foundation guidelines for ri to set up catalogues see
for any of the concepts which need to be documented datasets sensors physical samples the detailed recommendations for the implementation
of each of these catalogs are given in wp9 use cases as done for example for tc_4 sensor registry they
will propose standards and application profiles for the interoperability of the catalogs and propose tools for the implementation of the
catalog in the ri and federation of the ri catalog in single portal or superset catalogs dedicated to specific items
datasets sensors physical samples processes in the document specifically to promote the transdisciplinary nature of the envriplus cluster of research
infrastructures federated flagship data services and acquisition services catalogs is designed the detailed functional requirements see and standards application profiles
and tools see architecture are described in this document as first step for first half of the flagship data services
of ri represented as partners in task anaee euro argo embrc epos iagos icos lter seadatanet will be described in
eudat b2find community instance the superset catalog will be fed from iso19139 descriptions of these services provided and harvested from
the ri catalogs this catalog will be completed and improved then during the project with data service descriptions from other
ri in addition as described in the flagship acquisition services descriptions will be added to this catalog the flagship acquisition
services will nicely complement the data services in this catalog exposing and promoting the outcome of the ri at trans

utilizes cerif as its storage format and exchanges information in xml format within the oai pmh harvesting protocol oil and
cerif mapping as for iso dc or dcat standards cerif and oil should be mapped with the profile proposed from
the rda interest group in section oil is not refined at this level yet while cerif has numerous build in
mappings which should comply with the encoding proposed above cerif mappings exist to inspire iso19115 mapping has been done between
cerif and inspire and further work is ongoing in the epos project to deal with the varying dialects of inspire
dc dublin core while cerif to dc is quite straightforward although lossy te revere is not so simple because of
ambiguities in interpreting the dc metadata records which are commonly in textual or html form if they are qualified dc
now deprecated or encoded as rdf then resolution is straightforward however there are various dialects of dc so convertors may
need revision dcat mapping has been produced between cerif and dcat there is workshop sponsored by the vre4eic project and
w3c at the end of november to plan extensions to dcat to make it appropriately expressive and more aligned with
cerif which is used in vre4eic ckan metadata the ckan system has standard metadata not unlike dc however it is
usually encoded as rdf and so conversion is relatively straightforward this conversion cerif rdf was done initially in the engage
project and the software is now maintained by ekt in athens as general cerf rdf mapping and conversion oil in
the vre4eic project where en vriplus through uva is partner mapping between cerif and oil has been done using tools
supplied by forth in heraklion this is being extended in cooperative work between eurocris uva and forth within vre4eic https
